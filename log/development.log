[["author", "Paul Dix"], ["content", "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Earlier this week I had the opportunity to sit with six other people from the NYC technology scene and talk to NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn and a few members of her staff. <a href=\"http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com\" target=\"_self\">Charlie O'Donnell</a> organized the event to help Speaker Quinn engage with the startup scene and hear from us directly what the city can do, if anything, to help foster startups, tech, and innovation here in NYC. The two major themes that emerged from the discussion were: more on the ground interaction between city government and the tech community and that NYC has a major shortage of engineering talent. The resulting talk on the perceived programmer shortage in NYC is the inspiration for this post.</p>\r\n<p><br>Ask any startup in NYC (or anyone that needs a programmer for that matter) and most will agree that their biggest problem is finding programmers to hire. This was definitely the most prominent topic in the discussion with Speaker Quinn and her staff. The question then became: how do we solve this problem? How can the city government help? The group converged on education as the method to create more programming talent in the city (there wasn't much talk about what can be done to entice already qualified developers to move here). I agree completely that education is what is ultimately needed. An idea that I thought was spot on was required computer science classes for grade school students. We require math and physical sciences. Computers are just as ingrained and important in our society at this point as math and hard sciences. We need something more than teaching kids MS Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. That's like teaching kids how to use a match to light a fire and expecting them to be able to explain the second law of thermodynamics. However, that doesn't solve the immediate need. It's more of a 20 year plan.</p>\r\n<p><br>The group's idea to address the immediate need for programmers was to put together secondary classes to give training to those currently unemployed people that have interest in picking up new skills. The city can help immensely by providing space and letting those in need know about the availability of these classes. The thinking goes that people could pick up mobile application development or Ruby on Rails in a period of 3 to 6 months and then jump into the NYC startups that are so desperate for these skill sets. I contend that: first, there are more available engineers in this city than hiring startups claim, and second, this probably won't solve the programmer need to the satisfaction of those NYC startups that claim to be so desperate. Hence the <strong>myth</strong> that there are no available programmers in NYC and the <strong>truth</strong> that the best programmers are hard to find. But there is hope to fix this, let me explain...</p>\r\n<p><br>First, my claim that there are more engineers in this city than hiring startups claim. It's not that startups can't find anyone. I'm sure that startups with open positions came across resumes and even interview some candidates. It's just that they end up throwing out most of the resumes they see and giving the \"no hire\" stamp on most of the candidates they interview. I've been guilty of this myself. I've interviewed many candidates and given far more \"no hire\" than \"hire\" recommendations. I've also looked through a stack of resumes and thrown out a significant portion of them. This comes naturally from a startup's desire to only hire the best. This means that while startups are all screaming to the rafters about the shortage of programmers, there are programmers in this city that are available for hire. But there is hope...</p>\r\n<p><br>Second, my claim that secondary education in mobile app development or Ruby on Rails won't solve the programmer shortage to the satisfaction of NYC startups. This follows naturally from my first point: startups only want to hire the best. If they can't find the best they say that there are no \"qualified candidates\" out there. While I'm sure that some of the basics of web development or mobile apps can be taught in six months, the student won't be the best. Becoming the best takes years of education, personal study, practice, and work experience. Someone with no previous programming experience that picks up development over the course of six months will still be incredibly green. They will either not pass the resume filter for hiring or will get hung up on questions in the technical interview. In either case the result is the same: no hire and startups still can't find qualified candidates. But there is hope...</p>\r\n<p><br>The hurdles around retraining engineers that may not have your specific skill set and working with very junior programmers can be overcome. First, startups need to readjust their expectations. You don't need to have the best in everything. You don't even need a programmer that has your specific skill requirement in their resume. The key is to do pair programming with senior people paired up with junior people (or someone picking up something new). Within six months of full time pairing the junior people will have picked up so much that they'll be well on their way to being ready to mentor a new junior hire themselves.</p>\r\n<p><br>Getting students from these programming courses around the resume filter is also possible. The combination of two things will go a long way: require the students to create two or more projects and have the students put those projects up on Github. The two projects will give them invaluable experience. Further, they should be required to refactor as they go based on feedback from code review done by experienced developers. Requiring them to put the code on Github gives multiple advantages. First, they learn how to use source control as they write code. Second, the code reviews done by other developers can be done right there on the site and associated with each commit. Third, they'll have projects of reference that can be used to show prospective employers what exactly their classes taught them.</p>\r\n<p><br>For startups to get past the hurdle of hiring junior people they'll need to do a couple of things. First, embrace pair programming as a great method for bringing on junior developers and making them a key part of your team from the beginning (they'll be mid-level and senior before you know it). Second, readjust your expectations. You don't really need the most bad-ass developer you can find. If you did, you'd do whatever it took to poach them from their current job. Mid-level and senior developers paired with junior developers will do just fine for most startup's needs. If you can't find the best, senior, or mid-level developers to pair with junior hires, look to a consulting company. Pivotal Labs (they have a great new office here in NYC) is regularly brought in to pair with developers already in a startup. They do a great job of bringing in solid engineering process and bringing junior developers up to speed quickly (and they're not the only game in town). Finally, if you can't afford a consulting company or hiring senior developers, you'll need to do one of two things. Roll up your own sleeves and pick up some books and a keyboard, or be ok with the fact that you may only be able to convince someone without experience to work on your hot new startup idea (it's how I got started).</p>\r\n<p><br>There is definitely hope for the engineering shortage in NYC. It requires bringing on inexperienced people or those in need of retraining (C++ or Java to dynamic language anyone?) and helping them achieve their potential while letting them help you get your startup built. I'd like to thank Speaker Quinn, Sarah, and David from her staff for taking the time to talk to us. I hope that we'll come up with some great ideas and collaboration in the future to make innovation a permanent home here in NYC.</p>\r\n<p><br>What ideas do you have to increase the amount of talent here in the city?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> My friend <a href=\"http://twitter.com/brodyberg\" target=\"_self\">Brody Berg</a> wondered why I didn't write about the \"talent vortex\" in NYC that is the financial industry. I actually originally meant to, but simply forgot. So here is why I think the competition from the NYC financial market helps fuel the <strong>myth</strong> that it's impossible to find great talent in NYC.</p>\r\n<p>First, the finance industry generally pays their programmers quite well. Startups that are desperate for these people will just have to get used to it and offer competitive compensation packages. It's kind of like trying to hire programmers in Redmond or Bellevue, WA in the 90's. Microsoft was a huge talent vortex and offered larger salaries and better benefits. The same could have been said for Google from 2003-2008. You either get competitive or find people that these companies have overlooked.</p>\r\n<p>Which brings me to my second point: there are plenty of programmers to hire that the finance industry won't even look twice at. The intersection of the programmers you want and those that work in finance may not be as large as you think. Financial firms want people from name brand schools (preferably Ivy) with high GPAs (3.5 or greater is common). If you don't want to compete on compensation, look for programmers that don't fit their mold. Self-taught (and specially those with secondary education like this article talks about) are the kinds of programmers that will rarely get consideration from a financial firm.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the financial industry wants Java, dotNet, and C++ programmers. Chances are that if you're a startup, this isn't what you're after. Further, the finance industry has laid off quite a few programmers in the last three years. These are those experienced engineers that don't have the skill set that matches yours. They know Java, but they don't know Rails and Javascript. However, these are generally smart people that can pick it up very quickly on the job. The easiest way to find a Rails programmer right now is to poach from another community and teach them Rails.</p>\r\n<p>Competing with the financial firms is tough, but it's certainly doable.</p></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PaulDixExplainsNothing/~4/g6ifVrl_VcU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"], ["created_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:34:23 UTC +00:00], ["feed_id", 2], ["title", "Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink: The Myth and Truth of the NYC engineer shortage"], ["updated_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:34:23 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://www.pauldix.net/2011/01/water-water-everywhere-and-not-a-drop-to-drink-the-myth-and-truth-of-the-nyc-engineer-shortage.html"]]

[["author", "Paul Dix"], ["content", "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Well known VC and entrepreneur Mark Suster recently posted that you should \"<a href=\"http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/04/22/never-hire-job-hoppers-never-they-make-terrible-employees/\">Never Hire Job Hoppers. Never. They Make Terrible Employees.</a>\" I almost completely disagree. Before I dissect his argument I should provide a little disclaimer and background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The disclaimer:</strong> Mark is definitely more of an authority on the topic than I am. He's a VC and has run companies while I'm currently bootstrapping my own and haven't hired anyone yet. Additionally, there are many people in management and hiring positions that would agree with Mark (based on my own anecdotal conversations with people in hiring positions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The background:</strong> I'm guilty of being in the category of disloyal, self-serving, job-hopping scum that Mark is writing about. If you check my <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/pauldix\">LinkedIn profile</a> I have 11 positions listed starting in '98. However, I may get a special carve out upon further explanation of my history. I'll lay it out quickly because it's relevant to my argument later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the positions are current. One is part time consulting and the other is my startup. Ok, so 9 positions to explain now. Still in job hopping group. One I quit to go back to school. Three were temporary summer positions while I was in school. Now I'm down to 5, but that probably still makes me a job hopper. In one I was laid off because the startup ran out of runway. Another, I left because the previously mentioned startup had intellectual property (read: code) that sold and I was needed to help the buyer transition and integrate it. Now I'm down to three unexplained company departures. One I left because it was a contract position and the project was completed. The other two I left for other opportunities: one to join a startup and the other to start <a href=\"http://market.io/\">my own company</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all that out of the way let's dive into some of Mark's points. First, here's what he has to say about someone that has been identified as a job hopper due to having too many short positions on their resume:</p>\r\n<blockquote>You won’t even get through my filter (unless I know you or you’re recommended). No matter what your job hopping excuse is.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn't an argument against job hopping, it's an argument for finding a better filter. Now, you definitely won't get through Mark's filter, but you'd get through mine. Note that my filter is built for hiring engineers. Here are some filters in no particular order.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do you have relevant experience?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have a Github or other public code profile?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have a blog where you write about technical things?</li>\r\n<li>Are you involved in the community (attending user groups, meetups, etc.)?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have programming languages and technologies listed on your resume that you picked up in your free time?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these filters are designed to tell me if the candidate spends some of their free time improving their skills and advancing their career. Of course, most of those specific filters are only good for finding programmers. They also only apply to looking at resumes and not other things that come in an interview (like personality, culture fit, and more detailed technical stuff). However, people (and not just engineers) that work on their skills and career in their free time are more likely to be job hoppers unless their job is with them and helping to contribute to their growth. So detracting job hopping isn't part of my filter. I'll get into the why when I dig into his primary argument against them (us).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark goes on to define a job hopper. Notice the language he uses in his definition:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If you’re 30 and have had 6 jobs since college you’re 98% likely to be a job hopper. You’re probably disloyal. You don’t have staying power. You’re in it more for yourself than your company. OR … you make bad decisions about which companies you join.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There's a little more in his definition, but that's the meaty bit that I want to pick apart. First, the part about being disloyal. \"You're in it for yourself more than the company\"?! That's exactly what I expect of everyone I work with. They have families to feed, student loans to pay, rent to pay, and they have to be worried about whether their continued employment at the company will benefit their overall career. Everyone is in it for themselves. That's capitalism. The goal is to make is so that everyone's self interests align with that of the company. That means having the right stock options, opportunities for professional growth, acquiring new skills, and clear advancement opportunities. It's a company, not a commune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the part about making bad decisions about companies to join. As a VC Mark evaluates companies and hopes to find out of 10: 1 home run and maybe 2 base hits. He's ok if 7-8 of 10 companies in his portfolio fail completely. Job seekers don't have that luxury. They have to evaluate the companies out there and pick <strong>one</strong>. If it's the wrong one then they have to move on to the next. For job seekers to get through a portfolio of 10 companies it can take a decade of changing jobs each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next comes Mark's main argument, which I will boil down to the following: Job hoppers make bad employees at startups because startups need people that are loyal and job hoppers have proven that they are disloyal. First, let's talk about loyalty. I consider loyalty, respect, and love to be things that have to be earned. If you want loyalty without earning it, hire a dog. Giving out a paycheck every two weeks doesn't earn you loyalty. As the old saying goes: money can't buy you love, but it can buy you prostitutes (who probably won't be loyal). Loyalty should be earned by building an environment that is mutually beneficial. Further, you have to be sure to continually assess not only employees, but yourself to see if you're living up to their expectations of what a great workplace should be. Don't hire someone off the street and expect them to be loyal right off the bat just because you agreed to give them a paycheck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So have job hoppers proven that they are disloyal? For the purposes of Mark's filter the answer is yes, but I personally disagree. I would never fault someone for changing jobs because they felt it was better for their career, or going back to school, or moving to a new city, or because their manager was a jerk, or whatever. Mark's point is that job hopping establishes a pattern of disloyalty and, perhaps, personality flaws. However, you can look at it this way. People have can have a few reasons for staying at a job: it's awesome or they want to leave, but can't find another opportunity. There are many more reasons to <strong>leave</strong> a job. The truth is that you can't establish whether there is a pattern simply by looking at someone's resume. As my own resume explanations show, there are plenty of reasons to leave jobs. Leave the personality filter for the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark then puts job hoppers as not only no-hires, but also as people he wouldn't fund if they were entrepreneurs pitching their startup. Here's that part:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And good VC’s feel the same way. When my company hit the fan in 2001 I could have easily walked and gotten a better paying job. Anyone around then knows that B2B stood for “back-to-banking” and B2C stood for “back-to-consulting.” I took people’s money. It was my job to stay and try and make things better. When I’m looking to fund somebody I care about that loyalty and integrity. I can never know for sure but as I’ve written about before I’m certainly looking for resiliency.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So he views job hoppers as people that have proven that they are disloyal, lack integrity, and have no resiliency. Further, if you're a job hopper that will translate to how you view entrepreneurship. This is so <strong>off the mark</strong> it hurts my brain. Let me explain why. As an entrepreneur there is one benefit that ranks above all others. Stability and a big paycheck definitely aren't it. It's a sense of ownership. It's a sense of owning your own destiny. I've talked to a bunch of other entrepreneurs and they share that feeling. If you ask job hoppers why they left some of their jobs the story will be the opposite. They left because they weren't given enough ownership. They weren't included in vital decision making processes. When you have the ability to improve your workplace, you have no reason to hop jobs. Most jobs don't actually give their employees this chance. They're filled with bureaucracy and ridiculous power struggles. That's exactly the opposite of the startup and entrepreneurship experience.</p><p>I propose that Mark has it backwards. Job hoppers could be exactly the kind of people you want to find for your startup. The likely case is that you're a job hopper because you're willing to take risks, you're looking for something great to work on, you're looking for a job that gives you a sense of ownership, and you're looking for the right team. True, you could be a job hopper because you have serious personality flaws, but save that for the interview. If 2 out of 3 job hoppers have exactly the personality traits that make them well suited for startups and 1 is a disloyal scumbag, you're better off specifically filter <strong>for</strong> job hoppers.You won't ever find 2/3 odds in a stack of resumes.</p><p>Finally, I propose that an argument could be made that startups specifically <strong>don't</strong> want people that stay in jobs too long. These are people that have shown that they prefer stability over exploring  something new (or maybe they were the lucky few that found the right job on the first few tries). Stability is exactly the opposite of what you're signing up for when you join a startup. The person seeking stability over all else will be the first to leave in favor of a big company or government gig when things get dicey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The job hopping filter could be used in exactly the opposite way that Mark is suggesting. That shows that it is a poor filter. A filter should give you better than random odds and job hopping just doesn't. It could be good, it could be bad, you just don't know. There are too many reasons for someone to have many entries on the resume. Stick to what's there and don't try to read between the lines. </p><p>So who in the hell should you hire? Hire the best. Hire people that can leave your startup at any minute if they wanted to because they're so kick ass that they're constantly getting contacted by interested parties. Then it becomes your job to ensure that you're creating an environment that is equally as good as your people. Create a company that gives your people the most room for growth, creativity, a sense of ownership, and fun. And if you can't hire the best then hire people with any level of experience (novice, intermediate, advanced) that have promise. Then help them become the best so that they can leave any time they want. Hint: they won't. They'll be loyal because you helped them become the best. Your goal should be to help every single employee get to the point where they're the best in their field and are constantly getting job offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what if they aren't loyal once you've helped them become the best? People will eventually leave no matter what you do. Don't view it as a character flaw on their part. Just know that you can pick up more people because you've created a work environment that breeds the best and the word will spread. And as any job hopper can tell you, there are plenty of companies where your skill, ambition, and talent can go to die, but there are very few that help you become the best and give you real reasons to be loyal.</p></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PaulDixExplainsNothing/~4/6AgCE0EnGnk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"], ["created_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:34:23 UTC +00:00], ["feed_id", 2], ["title", "Why Mark Suster is wrong about not hiring job hoppers"], ["updated_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:34:23 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://www.pauldix.net/2010/04/why-mark-suster-is-wrong-about-not-hiring-job-hoppers.html"]]

With the help of <a href=\"http://metaclass.org/\">Wilson Bilkovich</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/dbalatero\">David Balatero</a> I've finished what I think is a significant improvement to the library. The new interface removes all the magic and opts instead for clarity.</p><p>It's really slick and includes improved stubing support, caching, memoization, and (of course) parallelism. The <a href=\"http://github.com/pauldix/typhoeus/\">Typhoeus readme</a> highlights all of the awesomeness. It should be noted that the old interface of including Typhoeus into classes and defining remote methods has been deprecated. I'll be removing that sometime in the next six months.</p><p>In addition to thanking everyone using the library and everyone contributing, I should also thank my employer kgbweb. If you're a solid Rubyist that likes parsing, crawling, and stuff, or a machine learning guy, or a Solr/Lucene/indexing bad ass, let me know.

[["author", "Paul Dix"], ["content", "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Earlier this week I had the opportunity to sit with six other people from the NYC technology scene and talk to NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn and a few members of her staff. <a href=\"http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com\" target=\"_self\">Charlie O'Donnell</a> organized the event to help Speaker Quinn engage with the startup scene and hear from us directly what the city can do, if anything, to help foster startups, tech, and innovation here in NYC. The two major themes that emerged from the discussion were: more on the ground interaction between city government and the tech community and that NYC has a major shortage of engineering talent. The resulting talk on the perceived programmer shortage in NYC is the inspiration for this post.</p>\r\n<p><br>Ask any startup in NYC (or anyone that needs a programmer for that matter) and most will agree that their biggest problem is finding programmers to hire. This was definitely the most prominent topic in the discussion with Speaker Quinn and her staff. The question then became: how do we solve this problem? How can the city government help? The group converged on education as the method to create more programming talent in the city (there wasn't much talk about what can be done to entice already qualified developers to move here). I agree completely that education is what is ultimately needed. An idea that I thought was spot on was required computer science classes for grade school students. We require math and physical sciences. Computers are just as ingrained and important in our society at this point as math and hard sciences. We need something more than teaching kids MS Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. That's like teaching kids how to use a match to light a fire and expecting them to be able to explain the second law of thermodynamics. However, that doesn't solve the immediate need. It's more of a 20 year plan.</p>\r\n<p><br>The group's idea to address the immediate need for programmers was to put together secondary classes to give training to those currently unemployed people that have interest in picking up new skills. The city can help immensely by providing space and letting those in need know about the availability of these classes. The thinking goes that people could pick up mobile application development or Ruby on Rails in a period of 3 to 6 months and then jump into the NYC startups that are so desperate for these skill sets. I contend that: first, there are more available engineers in this city than hiring startups claim, and second, this probably won't solve the programmer need to the satisfaction of those NYC startups that claim to be so desperate. Hence the <strong>myth</strong> that there are no available programmers in NYC and the <strong>truth</strong> that the best programmers are hard to find. But there is hope to fix this, let me explain...</p>\r\n<p><br>First, my claim that there are more engineers in this city than hiring startups claim. It's not that startups can't find anyone. I'm sure that startups with open positions came across resumes and even interview some candidates. It's just that they end up throwing out most of the resumes they see and giving the \"no hire\" stamp on most of the candidates they interview. I've been guilty of this myself. I've interviewed many candidates and given far more \"no hire\" than \"hire\" recommendations. I've also looked through a stack of resumes and thrown out a significant portion of them. This comes naturally from a startup's desire to only hire the best. This means that while startups are all screaming to the rafters about the shortage of programmers, there are programmers in this city that are available for hire. But there is hope...</p>\r\n<p><br>Second, my claim that secondary education in mobile app development or Ruby on Rails won't solve the programmer shortage to the satisfaction of NYC startups. This follows naturally from my first point: startups only want to hire the best. If they can't find the best they say that there are no \"qualified candidates\" out there. While I'm sure that some of the basics of web development or mobile apps can be taught in six months, the student won't be the best. Becoming the best takes years of education, personal study, practice, and work experience. Someone with no previous programming experience that picks up development over the course of six months will still be incredibly green. They will either not pass the resume filter for hiring or will get hung up on questions in the technical interview. In either case the result is the same: no hire and startups still can't find qualified candidates. But there is hope...</p>\r\n<p><br>The hurdles around retraining engineers that may not have your specific skill set and working with very junior programmers can be overcome. First, startups need to readjust their expectations. You don't need to have the best in everything. You don't even need a programmer that has your specific skill requirement in their resume. The key is to do pair programming with senior people paired up with junior people (or someone picking up something new). Within six months of full time pairing the junior people will have picked up so much that they'll be well on their way to being ready to mentor a new junior hire themselves.</p>\r\n<p><br>Getting students from these programming courses around the resume filter is also possible. The combination of two things will go a long way: require the students to create two or more projects and have the students put those projects up on Github. The two projects will give them invaluable experience. Further, they should be required to refactor as they go based on feedback from code review done by experienced developers. Requiring them to put the code on Github gives multiple advantages. First, they learn how to use source control as they write code. Second, the code reviews done by other developers can be done right there on the site and associated with each commit. Third, they'll have projects of reference that can be used to show prospective employers what exactly their classes taught them.</p>\r\n<p><br>For startups to get past the hurdle of hiring junior people they'll need to do a couple of things. First, embrace pair programming as a great method for bringing on junior developers and making them a key part of your team from the beginning (they'll be mid-level and senior before you know it). Second, readjust your expectations. You don't really need the most bad-ass developer you can find. If you did, you'd do whatever it took to poach them from their current job. Mid-level and senior developers paired with junior developers will do just fine for most startup's needs. If you can't find the best, senior, or mid-level developers to pair with junior hires, look to a consulting company. Pivotal Labs (they have a great new office here in NYC) is regularly brought in to pair with developers already in a startup. They do a great job of bringing in solid engineering process and bringing junior developers up to speed quickly (and they're not the only game in town). Finally, if you can't afford a consulting company or hiring senior developers, you'll need to do one of two things. Roll up your own sleeves and pick up some books and a keyboard, or be ok with the fact that you may only be able to convince someone without experience to work on your hot new startup idea (it's how I got started).</p>\r\n<p><br>There is definitely hope for the engineering shortage in NYC. It requires bringing on inexperienced people or those in need of retraining (C++ or Java to dynamic language anyone?) and helping them achieve their potential while letting them help you get your startup built. I'd like to thank Speaker Quinn, Sarah, and David from her staff for taking the time to talk to us. I hope that we'll come up with some great ideas and collaboration in the future to make innovation a permanent home here in NYC.</p>\r\n<p><br>What ideas do you have to increase the amount of talent here in the city?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> My friend <a href=\"http://twitter.com/brodyberg\" target=\"_self\">Brody Berg</a> wondered why I didn't write about the \"talent vortex\" in NYC that is the financial industry. I actually originally meant to, but simply forgot. So here is why I think the competition from the NYC financial market helps fuel the <strong>myth</strong> that it's impossible to find great talent in NYC.</p>\r\n<p>First, the finance industry generally pays their programmers quite well. Startups that are desperate for these people will just have to get used to it and offer competitive compensation packages. It's kind of like trying to hire programmers in Redmond or Bellevue, WA in the 90's. Microsoft was a huge talent vortex and offered larger salaries and better benefits. The same could have been said for Google from 2003-2008. You either get competitive or find people that these companies have overlooked.</p>\r\n<p>Which brings me to my second point: there are plenty of programmers to hire that the finance industry won't even look twice at. The intersection of the programmers you want and those that work in finance may not be as large as you think. Financial firms want people from name brand schools (preferably Ivy) with high GPAs (3.5 or greater is common). If you don't want to compete on compensation, look for programmers that don't fit their mold. Self-taught (and specially those with secondary education like this article talks about) are the kinds of programmers that will rarely get consideration from a financial firm.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the financial industry wants Java, dotNet, and C++ programmers. Chances are that if you're a startup, this isn't what you're after. Further, the finance industry has laid off quite a few programmers in the last three years. These are those experienced engineers that don't have the skill set that matches yours. They know Java, but they don't know Rails and Javascript. However, these are generally smart people that can pick it up very quickly on the job. The easiest way to find a Rails programmer right now is to poach from another community and teach them Rails.</p>\r\n<p>Competing with the financial firms is tough, but it's certainly doable.</p></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PaulDixExplainsNothing/~4/g6ifVrl_VcU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"], ["created_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:52:07 UTC +00:00], ["feed_id", 12], ["title", "Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink: The Myth and Truth of the NYC engineer shortage"], ["updated_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:52:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://www.pauldix.net/2011/01/water-water-everywhere-and-not-a-drop-to-drink-the-myth-and-truth-of-the-nyc-engineer-shortage.html"]]

Never. They Make Terrible Employees.</a>\" I almost completely disagree. Before I dissect his argument I should provide a little disclaimer and background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The disclaimer:</strong> Mark is definitely more of an authority on the topic than I am. He's a VC and has run companies while I'm currently bootstrapping my own and haven't hired anyone yet. Additionally, there are many people in management and hiring positions that would agree with Mark (based on my own anecdotal conversations with people in hiring positions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The background:</strong> I'm guilty of being in the category of disloyal, self-serving, job-hopping scum that Mark is writing about. If you check my <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/pauldix\">LinkedIn profile</a> I have 11 positions listed starting in '98. However, I may get a special carve out upon further explanation of my history. I'll lay it out quickly because it's relevant to my argument later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the positions are current. One is part time consulting and the other is my startup. Ok, so 9 positions to explain now. Still in job hopping group. One I quit to go back to school. Three were temporary summer positions while I was in school. Now I'm down to 5, but that probably still makes me a job hopper. In one I was laid off because the startup ran out of runway. Another, I left because the previously mentioned startup had intellectual property (read: code) that sold and I was needed to help the buyer transition and integrate it. Now I'm down to three unexplained company departures. One I left because it was a contract position and the project was completed. The other two I left for other opportunities: one to join a startup and the other to start <a href=\"http://market.io/\">my own company</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all that out of the way let's dive into some of Mark's points. First, here's what he has to say about someone that has been identified as a job hopper due to having too many short positions on their resume:</p>\r\n<blockquote>You won’t even get through my filter (unless I know you or you’re recommended). No matter what your job hopping excuse is.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn't an argument against job hopping, it's an argument for finding a better filter. Now, you definitely won't get through Mark's filter, but you'd get through mine. Note that my filter is built for hiring engineers. Here are some filters in no particular order.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do you have relevant experience?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have a Github or other public code profile?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have a blog where you write about technical things?</li>\r\n<li>Are you involved in the community (attending user groups, meetups, etc.)?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have programming languages and technologies listed on your resume that you picked up in your free time?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these filters are designed to tell me if the candidate spends some of their free time improving their skills and advancing their career. Of course, most of those specific filters are only good for finding programmers. They also only apply to looking at resumes and not other things that come in an interview (like personality, culture fit, and more detailed technical stuff). However, people (and not just engineers) that work on their skills and career in their free time are more likely to be job hoppers unless their job is with them and helping to contribute to their growth. So detracting job hopping isn't part of my filter. I'll get into the why when I dig into his primary argument against them (us).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark goes on to define a job hopper. Notice the language he uses in his definition:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If you’re 30 and have had 6 jobs since college you’re 98% likely to be a job hopper. You’re probably disloyal. You don’t have staying power. You’re in it more for yourself than your company. OR … you make bad decisions about which companies you join.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There's a little more in his definition, but that's the meaty bit that I want to pick apart. First, the part about being disloyal. \"You're in it for yourself more than the company\"?! That's exactly what I expect of everyone I work with. They have families to feed, student loans to pay, rent to pay, and they have to be worried about whether their continued employment at the company will benefit their overall career. Everyone is in it for themselves. That's capitalism. The goal is to make is so that everyone's self interests align with that of the company. That means having the right stock options, opportunities for professional growth, acquiring new skills, and clear advancement opportunities. It's a company, not a commune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the part about making bad decisions about companies to join. As a VC Mark evaluates companies and hopes to find out of 10: 1 home run and maybe 2 base hits. He's ok if 7-8 of 10 companies in his portfolio fail completely. Job seekers don't have that luxury. They have to evaluate the companies out there and pick <strong>one</strong>. If it's the wrong one then they have to move on to the next. For job seekers to get through a portfolio of 10 companies it can take a decade of changing jobs each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next comes Mark's main argument, which I will boil down to the following: Job hoppers make bad employees at startups because startups need people that are loyal and job hoppers have proven that they are disloyal. First, let's talk about loyalty. I consider loyalty, respect, and love to be things that have to be earned. If you want loyalty without earning it, hire a dog. Giving out a paycheck every two weeks doesn't earn you loyalty. As the old saying goes: money can't buy you love, but it can buy you prostitutes (who probably won't be loyal). Loyalty should be earned by building an environment that is mutually beneficial. Further, you have to be sure to continually assess not only employees, but yourself to see if you're living up to their expectations of what a great workplace should be. Don't hire someone off the street and expect them to be loyal right off the bat just because you agreed to give them a paycheck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So have job hoppers proven that they are disloyal? For the purposes of Mark's filter the answer is yes, but I personally disagree. I would never fault someone for changing jobs because they felt it was better for their career, or going back to school, or moving to a new city, or because their manager was a jerk, or whatever. Mark's point is that job hopping establishes a pattern of disloyalty and, perhaps, personality flaws. However, you can look at it this way. People have can have a few reasons for staying at a job: it's awesome or they want to leave, but can't find another opportunity. There are many more reasons to <strong>leave</strong> a job. The truth is that you can't establish whether there is a pattern simply by looking at someone's resume. As my own resume explanations show, there are plenty of reasons to leave jobs. Leave the personality filter for the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark then puts job hoppers as not only no-hires, but also as people he wouldn't fund if they were entrepreneurs pitching their startup. Here's that part:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And good VC’s feel the same way. When my company hit the fan in 2001 I could have easily walked and gotten a better paying job. Anyone around then knows that B2B stood for “back-to-banking” and B2C stood for “back-to-consulting.” I took people’s money. It was my job to stay and try and make things better. When I’m looking to fund somebody I care about that loyalty and integrity. I can never know for sure but as I’ve written about before I’m certainly looking for resiliency.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So he views job hoppers as people that have proven that they are disloyal, lack integrity, and have no resiliency. Further, if you're a job hopper that will translate to how you view entrepreneurship. This is so <strong>off the mark</strong> it hurts my brain. Let me explain why. As an entrepreneur there is one benefit that ranks above all others. Stability and a big paycheck definitely aren't it. It's a sense of ownership. It's a sense of owning your own destiny. I've talked to a bunch of other entrepreneurs and they share that feeling. If you ask job hoppers why they left some of their jobs the story will be the opposite. They left because they weren't given enough ownership. They weren't included in vital decision making processes. When you have the ability to improve your workplace, you have no reason to hop jobs. Most jobs don't actually give their employees this chance. They're filled with bureaucracy and ridiculous power struggles. That's exactly the opposite of the startup and entrepreneurship experience.</p><p>I propose that Mark has it backwards. Job hoppers could be exactly the kind of people you want to find for your startup. The likely case is that you're a job hopper because you're willing to take risks, you're looking for something great to work on, you're looking for a job that gives you a sense of ownership, and you're looking for the right team. True, you could be a job hopper because you have serious personality flaws, but save that for the interview. If 2 out of 3 job hoppers have exactly the personality traits that make them well suited for startups and 1 is a disloyal scumbag, you're better off specifically filter <strong>for</strong> job hoppers.You won't ever find 2/3 odds in a stack of resumes.</p><p>Finally, I propose that an argument could be made that startups specifically <strong>don't</strong> want people that stay in jobs too long. These are people that have shown that they prefer stability over exploring  something new (or maybe they were the lucky few that found the right job on the first few tries). Stability is exactly the opposite of what you're signing up for when you join a startup. The person seeking stability over all else will be the first to leave in favor of a big company or government gig when things get dicey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The job hopping filter could be used in exactly the opposite way that Mark is suggesting. That shows that it is a poor filter. A filter should give you better than random odds and job hopping just doesn't. It could be good, it could be bad, you just don't know. There are too many reasons for someone to have many entries on the resume. Stick to what's there and don't try to read between the lines. </p><p>So who in the hell should you hire? Hire the best. Hire people that can leave your startup at any minute if they wanted to because they're so kick ass that they're constantly getting contacted by interested parties. Then it becomes your job to ensure that you're creating an environment that is equally as good as your people. Create a company that gives your people the most room for growth, creativity, a sense of ownership, and fun. And if you can't hire the best then hire people with any level of experience (novice, intermediate, advanced) that have promise. Then help them become the best so that they can leave any time they want. Hint: they won't. They'll be loyal because you helped them become the best. Your goal should be to help every single employee get to the point where they're the best in their field and are constantly getting job offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what if they aren't loyal once you've helped them become the best? People will eventually leave no matter what you do. Don't view it as a character flaw on their part. Just know that you can pick up more people because you've created a work environment that breeds the best and the word will spread. And as any job hopper can tell you, there are plenty of companies where your skill, ambition, and talent can go to die, but there are very few that help you become the best and give you real reasons to be loyal.</p></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PaulDixExplainsNothing/~4/6AgCE0EnGnk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"], ["created_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:52:07 UTC +00:00], ["feed_id", 12], ["title", "Why Mark Suster is wrong about not hiring job hoppers"], ["updated_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 02:52:07 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://www.pauldix.net/2010/04/why-mark-suster-is-wrong-about-not-hiring-job-hoppers.html"]]

With the help of <a href=\"http://metaclass.org/\">Wilson Bilkovich</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/dbalatero\">David Balatero</a> I've finished what I think is a significant improvement to the library. The new interface removes all the magic and opts instead for clarity.</p><p>It's really slick and includes improved stubing support, caching, memoization, and (of course) parallelism. The <a href=\"http://github.com/pauldix/typhoeus/\">Typhoeus readme</a> highlights all of the awesomeness. It should be noted that the old interface of including Typhoeus into classes and defining remote methods has been deprecated. I'll be removing that sometime in the next six months.</p><p>In addition to thanking everyone using the library and everyone contributing, I should also thank my employer kgbweb. If you're a solid Rubyist that likes parsing, crawling, and stuff, or a machine learning guy, or a Solr/Lucene/indexing bad ass, let me know.

The two major themes that emerged from the discussion were: more on the ground interaction between city government and the tech community and that NYC has a major shortage of engineering talent. The resulting talk on the perceived programmer shortage in NYC is the inspiration for this post.</p>\r\n<p><br>Ask any startup in NYC (or anyone that needs a programmer for that matter) and most will agree that their biggest problem is finding programmers to hire. This was definitely the most prominent topic in the discussion with Speaker Quinn and her staff. The question then became: how do we solve this problem? How can the city government help? The group converged on education as the method to create more programming talent in the city (there wasn't much talk about what can be done to entice already qualified developers to move here). I agree completely that education is what is ultimately needed. An idea that I thought was spot on was required computer science classes for grade school students. We require math and physical sciences. Computers are just as ingrained and important in our society at this point as math and hard sciences. We need something more than teaching kids MS Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. That's like teaching kids how to use a match to light a fire and expecting them to be able to explain the second law of thermodynamics. However, that doesn't solve the immediate need. It's more of a 20 year plan.</p>\r\n<p><br>The group's idea to address the immediate need for programmers was to put together secondary classes to give training to those currently unemployed people that have interest in picking up new skills. The city can help immensely by providing space and letting those in need know about the availability of these classes. The thinking goes that people could pick up mobile application development or Ruby on Rails in a period of 3 to 6 months and then jump into the NYC startups that are so desperate for these skill sets. I contend that: first, there are more available engineers in this city than hiring startups claim, and second, this probably won't solve the programmer need to the satisfaction of those NYC startups that claim to be so desperate. Hence the <strong>myth</strong> that there are no available programmers in NYC and the <strong>truth</strong> that the best programmers are hard to find. But there is hope to fix this, let me explain...</p>\r\n<p><br>First, my claim that there are more engineers in this city than hiring startups claim. It's not that startups can't find anyone. I'm sure that startups with open positions came across resumes and even interview some candidates. It's just that they end up throwing out most of the resumes they see and giving the \"no hire\" stamp on most of the candidates they interview. I've been guilty of this myself. I've interviewed many candidates and given far more \"no hire\" than \"hire\" recommendations. I've also looked through a stack of resumes and thrown out a significant portion of them. This comes naturally from a startup's desire to only hire the best. This means that while startups are all screaming to the rafters about the shortage of programmers, there are programmers in this city that are available for hire. But there is hope...</p>\r\n<p><br>Second, my claim that secondary education in mobile app development or Ruby on Rails won't solve the programmer shortage to the satisfaction of NYC startups. This follows naturally from my first point: startups only want to hire the best. If they can't find the best they say that there are no \"qualified candidates\" out there. While I'm sure that some of the basics of web development or mobile apps can be taught in six months, the student won't be the best. Becoming the best takes years of education, personal study, practice, and work experience. Someone with no previous programming experience that picks up development over the course of six months will still be incredibly green. They will either not pass the resume filter for hiring or will get hung up on questions in the technical interview. In either case the result is the same: no hire and startups still can't find qualified candidates. But there is hope...</p>\r\n<p><br>The hurdles around retraining engineers that may not have your specific skill set and working with very junior programmers can be overcome. First, startups need to readjust their expectations. You don't need to have the best in everything. You don't even need a programmer that has your specific skill requirement in their resume. The key is to do pair programming with senior people paired up with junior people (or someone picking up something new). Within six months of full time pairing the junior people will have picked up so much that they'll be well on their way to being ready to mentor a new junior hire themselves.</p>\r\n<p><br>Getting students from these programming courses around the resume filter is also possible. The combination of two things will go a long way: require the students to create two or more projects and have the students put those projects up on Github. The two projects will give them invaluable experience. Further, they should be required to refactor as they go based on feedback from code review done by experienced developers. Requiring them to put the code on Github gives multiple advantages. First, they learn how to use source control as they write code. Second, the code reviews done by other developers can be done right there on the site and associated with each commit. Third, they'll have projects of reference that can be used to show prospective employers what exactly their classes taught them.</p>\r\n<p><br>For startups to get past the hurdle of hiring junior people they'll need to do a couple of things. First, embrace pair programming as a great method for bringing on junior developers and making them a key part of your team from the beginning (they'll be mid-level and senior before you know it). Second, readjust your expectations. You don't really need the most bad-ass developer you can find. If you did, you'd do whatever it took to poach them from their current job. Mid-level and senior developers paired with junior developers will do just fine for most startup's needs. If you can't find the best, senior, or mid-level developers to pair with junior hires, look to a consulting company. Pivotal Labs (they have a great new office here in NYC) is regularly brought in to pair with developers already in a startup. They do a great job of bringing in solid engineering process and bringing junior developers up to speed quickly (and they're not the only game in town). Finally, if you can't afford a consulting company or hiring senior developers, you'll need to do one of two things. Roll up your own sleeves and pick up some books and a keyboard, or be ok with the fact that you may only be able to convince someone without experience to work on your hot new startup idea (it's how I got started).</p>\r\n<p><br>There is definitely hope for the engineering shortage in NYC. It requires bringing on inexperienced people or those in need of retraining (C++ or Java to dynamic language anyone?) and helping them achieve their potential while letting them help you get your startup built. I'd like to thank Speaker Quinn, Sarah, and David from her staff for taking the time to talk to us. I hope that we'll come up with some great ideas and collaboration in the future to make innovation a permanent home here in NYC.</p>\r\n<p><br>What ideas do you have to increase the amount of talent here in the city?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> My friend <a href=\"http://twitter.com/brodyberg\" target=\"_self\">Brody Berg</a> wondered why I didn't write about the \"talent vortex\" in NYC that is the financial industry. I actually originally meant to, but simply forgot. So here is why I think the competition from the NYC financial market helps fuel the <strong>myth</strong> that it's impossible to find great talent in NYC.</p>\r\n<p>First, the finance industry generally pays their programmers quite well. Startups that are desperate for these people will just have to get used to it and offer competitive compensation packages. It's kind of like trying to hire programmers in Redmond or Bellevue, WA in the 90's. Microsoft was a huge talent vortex and offered larger salaries and better benefits. The same could have been said for Google from 2003-2008. You either get competitive or find people that these companies have overlooked.</p>\r\n<p>Which brings me to my second point: there are plenty of programmers to hire that the finance industry won't even look twice at. The intersection of the programmers you want and those that work in finance may not be as large as you think. Financial firms want people from name brand schools (preferably Ivy) with high GPAs (3.5 or greater is common). If you don't want to compete on compensation, look for programmers that don't fit their mold. Self-taught (and specially those with secondary education like this article talks about) are the kinds of programmers that will rarely get consideration from a financial firm.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the financial industry wants Java, dotNet, and C++ programmers. Chances are that if you're a startup, this isn't what you're after. Further, the finance industry has laid off quite a few programmers in the last three years. These are those experienced engineers that don't have the skill set that matches yours. They know Java, but they don't know Rails and Javascript. However, these are generally smart people that can pick it up very quickly on the job. The easiest way to find a Rails programmer right now is to poach from another community and teach them Rails.</p>\r\n<p>Competing with the financial firms is tough, but it's certainly doable.</p></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=g6ifVrl_VcU:RNGm1bOkDvc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PaulDixExplainsNothing/~4/g6ifVrl_VcU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"], ["created_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 03:01:45 UTC +00:00], ["feed_id", 1], ["preview", "Earlier this week I had the opportunity to sit with six other people from the NYC technology scene and talk to NYC Council Speaker Christine Quinn and a few members of her staff.

Never. They Make Terrible Employees.</a>\" I almost completely disagree. Before I dissect his argument I should provide a little disclaimer and background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The disclaimer:</strong> Mark is definitely more of an authority on the topic than I am. He's a VC and has run companies while I'm currently bootstrapping my own and haven't hired anyone yet. Additionally, there are many people in management and hiring positions that would agree with Mark (based on my own anecdotal conversations with people in hiring positions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The background:</strong> I'm guilty of being in the category of disloyal, self-serving, job-hopping scum that Mark is writing about. If you check my <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/pauldix\">LinkedIn profile</a> I have 11 positions listed starting in '98. However, I may get a special carve out upon further explanation of my history. I'll lay it out quickly because it's relevant to my argument later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the positions are current. One is part time consulting and the other is my startup. Ok, so 9 positions to explain now. Still in job hopping group. One I quit to go back to school. Three were temporary summer positions while I was in school. Now I'm down to 5, but that probably still makes me a job hopper. In one I was laid off because the startup ran out of runway. Another, I left because the previously mentioned startup had intellectual property (read: code) that sold and I was needed to help the buyer transition and integrate it. Now I'm down to three unexplained company departures. One I left because it was a contract position and the project was completed. The other two I left for other opportunities: one to join a startup and the other to start <a href=\"http://market.io/\">my own company</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all that out of the way let's dive into some of Mark's points. First, here's what he has to say about someone that has been identified as a job hopper due to having too many short positions on their resume:</p>\r\n<blockquote>You won’t even get through my filter (unless I know you or you’re recommended). No matter what your job hopping excuse is.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn't an argument against job hopping, it's an argument for finding a better filter. Now, you definitely won't get through Mark's filter, but you'd get through mine. Note that my filter is built for hiring engineers. Here are some filters in no particular order.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do you have relevant experience?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have a Github or other public code profile?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have a blog where you write about technical things?</li>\r\n<li>Are you involved in the community (attending user groups, meetups, etc.)?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have programming languages and technologies listed on your resume that you picked up in your free time?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these filters are designed to tell me if the candidate spends some of their free time improving their skills and advancing their career. Of course, most of those specific filters are only good for finding programmers. They also only apply to looking at resumes and not other things that come in an interview (like personality, culture fit, and more detailed technical stuff). However, people (and not just engineers) that work on their skills and career in their free time are more likely to be job hoppers unless their job is with them and helping to contribute to their growth. So detracting job hopping isn't part of my filter. I'll get into the why when I dig into his primary argument against them (us).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark goes on to define a job hopper. Notice the language he uses in his definition:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If you’re 30 and have had 6 jobs since college you’re 98% likely to be a job hopper. You’re probably disloyal. You don’t have staying power. You’re in it more for yourself than your company. OR … you make bad decisions about which companies you join.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There's a little more in his definition, but that's the meaty bit that I want to pick apart. First, the part about being disloyal. \"You're in it for yourself more than the company\"?! That's exactly what I expect of everyone I work with. They have families to feed, student loans to pay, rent to pay, and they have to be worried about whether their continued employment at the company will benefit their overall career. Everyone is in it for themselves. That's capitalism. The goal is to make is so that everyone's self interests align with that of the company. That means having the right stock options, opportunities for professional growth, acquiring new skills, and clear advancement opportunities. It's a company, not a commune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the part about making bad decisions about companies to join. As a VC Mark evaluates companies and hopes to find out of 10: 1 home run and maybe 2 base hits. He's ok if 7-8 of 10 companies in his portfolio fail completely. Job seekers don't have that luxury. They have to evaluate the companies out there and pick <strong>one</strong>. If it's the wrong one then they have to move on to the next. For job seekers to get through a portfolio of 10 companies it can take a decade of changing jobs each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next comes Mark's main argument, which I will boil down to the following: Job hoppers make bad employees at startups because startups need people that are loyal and job hoppers have proven that they are disloyal. First, let's talk about loyalty. I consider loyalty, respect, and love to be things that have to be earned. If you want loyalty without earning it, hire a dog. Giving out a paycheck every two weeks doesn't earn you loyalty. As the old saying goes: money can't buy you love, but it can buy you prostitutes (who probably won't be loyal). Loyalty should be earned by building an environment that is mutually beneficial. Further, you have to be sure to continually assess not only employees, but yourself to see if you're living up to their expectations of what a great workplace should be. Don't hire someone off the street and expect them to be loyal right off the bat just because you agreed to give them a paycheck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So have job hoppers proven that they are disloyal? For the purposes of Mark's filter the answer is yes, but I personally disagree. I would never fault someone for changing jobs because they felt it was better for their career, or going back to school, or moving to a new city, or because their manager was a jerk, or whatever. Mark's point is that job hopping establishes a pattern of disloyalty and, perhaps, personality flaws. However, you can look at it this way. People have can have a few reasons for staying at a job: it's awesome or they want to leave, but can't find another opportunity. There are many more reasons to <strong>leave</strong> a job. The truth is that you can't establish whether there is a pattern simply by looking at someone's resume. As my own resume explanations show, there are plenty of reasons to leave jobs. Leave the personality filter for the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark then puts job hoppers as not only no-hires, but also as people he wouldn't fund if they were entrepreneurs pitching their startup. Here's that part:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And good VC’s feel the same way. When my company hit the fan in 2001 I could have easily walked and gotten a better paying job. Anyone around then knows that B2B stood for “back-to-banking” and B2C stood for “back-to-consulting.” I took people’s money. It was my job to stay and try and make things better. When I’m looking to fund somebody I care about that loyalty and integrity. I can never know for sure but as I’ve written about before I’m certainly looking for resiliency.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So he views job hoppers as people that have proven that they are disloyal, lack integrity, and have no resiliency. Further, if you're a job hopper that will translate to how you view entrepreneurship. This is so <strong>off the mark</strong> it hurts my brain. Let me explain why. As an entrepreneur there is one benefit that ranks above all others. Stability and a big paycheck definitely aren't it. It's a sense of ownership. It's a sense of owning your own destiny. I've talked to a bunch of other entrepreneurs and they share that feeling. If you ask job hoppers why they left some of their jobs the story will be the opposite. They left because they weren't given enough ownership. They weren't included in vital decision making processes. When you have the ability to improve your workplace, you have no reason to hop jobs. Most jobs don't actually give their employees this chance. They're filled with bureaucracy and ridiculous power struggles. That's exactly the opposite of the startup and entrepreneurship experience.</p><p>I propose that Mark has it backwards. Job hoppers could be exactly the kind of people you want to find for your startup. The likely case is that you're a job hopper because you're willing to take risks, you're looking for something great to work on, you're looking for a job that gives you a sense of ownership, and you're looking for the right team. True, you could be a job hopper because you have serious personality flaws, but save that for the interview. If 2 out of 3 job hoppers have exactly the personality traits that make them well suited for startups and 1 is a disloyal scumbag, you're better off specifically filter <strong>for</strong> job hoppers.You won't ever find 2/3 odds in a stack of resumes.</p><p>Finally, I propose that an argument could be made that startups specifically <strong>don't</strong> want people that stay in jobs too long. These are people that have shown that they prefer stability over exploring  something new (or maybe they were the lucky few that found the right job on the first few tries). Stability is exactly the opposite of what you're signing up for when you join a startup. The person seeking stability over all else will be the first to leave in favor of a big company or government gig when things get dicey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The job hopping filter could be used in exactly the opposite way that Mark is suggesting. That shows that it is a poor filter. A filter should give you better than random odds and job hopping just doesn't. It could be good, it could be bad, you just don't know. There are too many reasons for someone to have many entries on the resume. Stick to what's there and don't try to read between the lines. </p><p>So who in the hell should you hire? Hire the best. Hire people that can leave your startup at any minute if they wanted to because they're so kick ass that they're constantly getting contacted by interested parties. Then it becomes your job to ensure that you're creating an environment that is equally as good as your people. Create a company that gives your people the most room for growth, creativity, a sense of ownership, and fun. And if you can't hire the best then hire people with any level of experience (novice, intermediate, advanced) that have promise. Then help them become the best so that they can leave any time they want. Hint: they won't. They'll be loyal because you helped them become the best. Your goal should be to help every single employee get to the point where they're the best in their field and are constantly getting job offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what if they aren't loyal once you've helped them become the best? People will eventually leave no matter what you do. Don't view it as a character flaw on their part. Just know that you can pick up more people because you've created a work environment that breeds the best and the word will spread. And as any job hopper can tell you, there are plenty of companies where your skill, ambition, and talent can go to die, but there are very few that help you become the best and give you real reasons to be loyal.</p></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?a=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PaulDixExplainsNothing?i=6AgCE0EnGnk:sxOSKuphXTA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PaulDixExplainsNothing/~4/6AgCE0EnGnk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"], ["created_at", Wed, 03 Apr 2013 03:01:45 UTC +00:00], ["feed_id", 1], ["preview", "Well known VC and entrepreneur Mark Suster recently posted that you should \"Never Hire Job Hoppers.

These new capabilities include:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Mobile Services</strong>: HTML5/JS (CORS) Client + PhoneGap + Windows Phone 7.5 + .NET Portable Library support </li>    <li><strong>Web Sites</strong>: Mercurial Source Control + Dropbox Deployment support </li>    <li><strong>HDInsight</strong>: New service that enables you to easily deploy and manage Hadoop Clusters on Azure </li> </ul>  <p>All of these improvements are now available to start using immediately (note: some services are still in preview). Below are more details on them:</p>  <h2><u>Mobile Services: HTML5/JS Client (CORS), PhoneGap, Windows Phone 7.5</u></h2>  <p>Today we are adding support to enable pure HTML5/JS clients (and PhoneGap apps) as well as Windows Phone 7.5 clients to use Windows Azure Mobile Services as a backend.&#160; This comes in addition to the new <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/03/04/windows-azure-updates-android-support-sql-reporting-services-active-directory-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Android SDK for Windows Azure Mobile Services</a> we released two weeks ago (as well as the Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and iOS support we had earlier). </p>  <p><u><strong>HTML5/JS Clients</strong></u></p>  <p>You can now connect both HTML5 web client apps as well as Apache Cordova/PhoneGap apps to your Mobile Services, and use Windows Azure for both data storage and authentication.&#160; We are delivering this via:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>New Mobile Services web client library</b> that supports IE8+ browsers, current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, plus PhoneGap 2.3.0+. It offers the same data querying and storage APIs support we have in other native SDKs, and allows easy user authentication via any of the four identity providers supported by Mobile Services (Microsoft Account, Google, Facebook, and Twitter). Please use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services/issues\">GitHub issue tracker</a> to report any issues, and <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/\">our forum</a> to get help. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support</b> to enable your Mobile Service to accept cross-domain Ajax requests. You can now configure a whitelist of allowed domains for your Mobile Service using the Windows Azure management portal. </li> </ul>  <p>To get started, create a mobile service in the <a href=\"http://manage.windowsazure.com\">Windows Azure Management Portal</a> and open the Quickstart tab. You can now select “HTML” and find the steps to create a new HTML5/JS client or add a backend to an existing one: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_71F2F2B0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_338D2EFD.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"478\" /></a> </p>  <p>You can then continue with <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-html/\">this tutorial</a> for the remaining steps and build a simple HTML5 todo list app (that runs entirely in a browser) in under 5 minutes. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_38064075.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_13087FFC.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"293\" /></a> </p>  <p>When deploying the HTML5 front-end app to a production environment, make sure to add the host name of the website you use to host it to your Windows Azure Mobile Services’ Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) whitelist using the <strong>Configure</strong> tab as shown below:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6E0ABF82.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_04CC97BD.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"478\" /></a> </p>  <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/mobile\">Windows Azure Mobile dev center</a> and read <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-html/\">this tutorial</a> to learn more about working with server-side data, or <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-html/\">this one</a> if you want to learn more about authenticating users.</p>  <p><strong><u>Windows Phone 7.5 Support and a new C# Client Library on NuGet</u></strong></p>  <p>A few days ago we published a <a href=\"http://nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.MobileServices/0.3.0-alpha\">preview of our next version of the Mobile Services C# client library</a> on NuGet.&#160; The goal of this pre-release is to give Mobile Services developers an early look at the new features we are planning for our next C# SDK update and an opportunity to try them out ahead of time. Some of the great new features we have added include:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>Portable Library Support</b>: We have consolidated our Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 clients on top of a single codebase using Portable Libraries. This enables us to reach a variety of new client platforms, as well as enable you to call Mobile Services from your ASP.NET and .NET server backend. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Windows Phone 7.5 support:</b> With the move to Portable Libraries, we are also enabling support for Windows Phone 7.5</li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Json.NET and HttpClient: </b>We migrated our implementation to use the latest and most flexible HTTP components to enable maximum robustness and extensibility. </li> </ul>  <p>Note: Today’s drop is a pre-release. For production apps we recommend continuing to use the “stable” Mobile Service client libraries for .NET available for download <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/developer-tools/\">here</a>.&#160; </p>  <p><strong><u>Keep Giving Us Feedback</u></strong></p>  <p>Please continue to visit our <a href=\"https://mobileservices.uservoice.com/forums/182281-feature-requests/filters/top\" target=\"_blank\">uservoice</a> page to let us know what you’d like to see added next (today’s release added 3 of the top 5 asks in uservoice!). <a href=\"mailto:mobileservices@microsoft.com?subject=Windows%20Azure%20Mobile%20Services%20adds%20Android%20support,%20will%20deliver%20additional%20SDKs%20and%20extends%20availability%20to%20East%20Asia%20\">Email us</a> to show off your app, and ask questions in our <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/threads\">forum</a> whenever you run into a problem.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Web Sites: Mercurial and Dropbox Deployment Support</u></h2>  <p>Today’s release also includes a number of deployment/publishing enhancements to Windows Azure Web Sites:</p>  <p><strong><u>Mercurial Source Control Support</u></strong></p>  <p>You can now use Mercurial (Hg) repositories when setting up continuous deployment of your Websites from your CodePlex or Bitbucket repositories.&#160; This is in addition to the TFS, CodePlex, Git and GitHub source control provider support that we previously supported.&#160; </p>  <p>Today’s release also includes improved UI that makes it even easier to setup deployment from source-control.&#160; Simply click the “Setup deployment from source control” link on your web-site dashboard, and a new wizard will appear that makes it trivial to walkthrough setting up publishing endpoints using a variety of source control providers and sites.&#160; For example, below is how you could choose to enable source code deployment from a public or private Mercurial (Hg) repository you might have on Bitbucket:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_78CAA788.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0F8C7FC3.png\" width=\"688\" height=\"484\" /></a> </p>  <p><strong><u>Dropbox Deployment Support</u></strong></p>  <p>Windows Azure also now supports site/app deployment from Dropbox to Web sites, making website deployment as easy as copying files to a folder on your local computer.&#160; To enable this from the Windows Azure management portal, click the “Set up deployment from source control” link on your Web site dashboard, choose Dropbox and authorize the connection, and then choose a Dropbox sub-folder to synchronize: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_38971EBF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4186B0FE.png\" width=\"680\" height=\"476\" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>You can then simply copy your source files to the Dropbox sub-folder on your local computer and press the “Sync” button in the Windows Azure Portal to deploy the files.&#160; Windows Azure will automatically build sources as needed, similar to Git or TFS based deployments.&#160; Also, the deployment history tab in the portal will keep track of your deployments and enables you to re-deploy any previous deployment with the click of a button.</p>  <p>Watch this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC1xAjz6jHI&amp;hd=1\" target=\"_blank\">2 minute screencast</a> to see how easy it now is to deploy web sites to Windows Azure using Dropbox.</p>  <p><strong><u>Improved UI for Managing Source Control Deployments</u></strong></p>  <p>In addition to the new setup wizard for source control deployment, today’s Windows Azure release also includes some other nice enhancements to the source control UI.&#160; Deployment history in the management portal now accurately reflects which source control provider is connected for continuous deployment, such as TFS, CodePlex, GitHub, or Bitbucket.&#160; It is also now possible to disconnect from an already connected source provider on a web-site in order to set up a different one (previously you had to delete the site to do this).</p>  <p><strong><u>TFS Certificate Renewal</u></strong></p>  <p>It’s also now possible to renew the certificate used by Team Foundation Service for continuous deployment directly from the Windows Azure management portal. To do this, click the “Renew TFS certificate” link on either the Dashboard or Quick Start page.</p>  <p><strong><u>Support for Regenerating the Publish Profile</u></strong></p>  <p>Today you can download a publish profile from the Web Sites dashboard. Once that profile is downloaded, the credentials are basically good forever. We understand that this is not optimal. To address this, with today’s release we are introducing a new quick glance command in the dashboard called <b>Reset publish profile credentials</b>. When clicked, you will get a confirmation for resetting the credentials and the credentials are regenerated.</p>  <h2><u>New HDInsight Server: Deploy and Manage Hadoop Clusters on Azure</u></h2>  <p>Today we also <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286692\">released</a> a public preview of the new HDInsight Service for Windows Azure. HDInsight provides everything you need to quickly deploy, manage and use Hadoop clusters running on Windows Azure. </p>  <p>If you have a Windows Azure account you can <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286685\">request access</a> to the HDInsight Preview and then easily create an HDInsight cluster within the <a href=\"http://manage.windowsazure.com\">Windows Azure Management Portal</a>. Within the Windows Azure Management Portal click the New button and select the new HDInsight service to create a Hadoop cluster.&#160; Specify a name for the cluster, a password for logging into the cluster and the size of cluster you need:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_75BADA44.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_69B8EA10.png\" width=\"868\" height=\"580\" /></a> </p>  <p><em>Note: a storage account is required to create a cluster and in the current public preview the storage account must reside in the East US region. The Azure Storage account you associate with your cluster is where you will store the data that you will analyze in HDInsight.</em></p>  <p><strong><u>HDInsight Clusters</u></strong></p>  <p>A cluster will take a few minutes to create (as part of creating it will configure the necessary Virtual Machines that together make up your Hadoop cluster). The Hadoop components installed as part of an HDInsight cluster are outlined <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286746\">here</a>. Once the cluster is created, you can drill into the dashboard view to see the cluster quick glance screen. This quick glance allows you to see the basic information about your cluster and gives you a simple method to connect to the cluster (just click the <strong>Manage</strong> button at the bottom of the dashboard).</p>  <p>When you connect to the cluster you’ll see a page that contains a number of tiles that provide information about the cluster and can be used to perform additional tasks:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_75513800.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5B7D01D1.png\" width=\"649\" height=\"505\" /></a> </p>  <p>The <b>Create Job</b> tile opens a MapReduce job submission form that you can use to submit <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=287075\" target=\"_blank\">MapReduce</a> jobs as JAR files. The <b>Interactive Console</b> tile opens a console that lets you execute Javascript and <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/hdinsight/using-hive-with-hdinsight/\">Hive</a> queries directly against your cluster.&#160; The <strong>Samples</strong> title includes samples that you can use to get started.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it!</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

To get started, create a SQL Reporting service by selecting <b>NEW -&gt; SQL REPORTING -&gt; QUICK CREATE</b>. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7989FF01.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7BC687BD.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"354\" /></a> </p>  <p>Once created, the <b>QUICK START</b> tab provides useful information for you to get started including links to tools and helpful articles on MSDN: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_16FEE0BF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_59055000.png\" width=\"796\" height=\"474\" /></a> </p>  <p>You can monitor the average and maximum number of reports processed in the dashboard view of your SQL reporting service.&#160; You can add users and manage permissions using the Users and Items tabs.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h2><u>Active Directory Integration</u></h2>  <p>We have made some great improvements with this week’s release in bringing enterprise level identity management to Windows Azure.&#160; Companies who sign up for Windows Azure as organizations (by creating a new Windows Azure Active Directory or signing up for Windows Azure with their Office 365 identity) will now find several new capabilities in the Windows Azure Management Portal:</p>  <ul>   <li>Ability to create and manage user accounts in your Windows Azure Active Directory. </li>    <li>Phone based two factor authentication for users who are Global Administrators in Windows Azure AD.</li>    <li>Ability to sync users from an on-premise Active Directory.&#160; </li>    <li>Ability to establish single sign with Azure (and other Microsoft Services like Office 365) using Active Directory Federation Services.</li> </ul>  <p>The Active Directory tab within the Windows Azure Management Portal now allows you to see all directories that your account is managing, as well as create and manage users, domains and directory integration settings:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_54229C44.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1D4847FE.png\" width=\"856\" height=\"429\" /></a> </p>  <p>For a more detailed discussion of the new Active Directory support, read Alex Simons’ post on the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2013/02/26/more-identity-and-access-management-improvements-in-windows-azure.aspx\">Azure Blog</a>.&#160; You’ll see this AD support get even better in the months ahead.</p>  <h2><u>Availability Monitoring for Cloud Services, Websites, Mobile Services, and VMs</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release we are enabling a new preview feature that will let you monitor the availability of your web applications. Web availability monitoring helps you understand the response time and availability of your web application from different locations around the world. This feature is available for Websites and Mobile Services in reserved mode, Cloud services in production environment, and for Virtual Machines.</p>  <p>You can try the web endpoint monitoring support in Windows Azure and enable your http/https endpoints to be tested from different locations. For example, to monitor your Web Site, scale the Web Site to reserved mode and then navigate to the configure page for the Web Site. Within the configure page, navigate to the monitoring section:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6A784189.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1AA21CFE.png\" width=\"878\" height=\"292\" /></a> </p>  <p>The monitoring section allows you to add multiple URLs that you wish to monitor.&#160; Add a friendly name for each URL and select the locations around the world that you wish to monitor it from. With this week’s preview you can monitor the Web URL from up to 3 test locations. After you have saved the configuration, the Web Site’s URL will be tested once every 5 minutes from each of the configured locations.</p>  <p>The results of the tests can be viewed on the Web Site’s dashboard as well as from the monitoring tab:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_07ED2347.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6A0E9F45.png\" width=\"801\" height=\"425\" /></a> </p>  <p>Availability is monitored using HTTP response codes, and response time. The Web Site is considered down when the response time is greater than 30 seconds or the HTTP status code is greater than 400.&#160; </p>  <p>The same features are available for Virtual Machines, Mobile Services and Cloud Services (in Production slot).</p>  <h2><u>Service Bus Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With this release, we have added some nice new capabilities to the Service Bus experience. First, the new <b>CONFIGURATION</b> tabs for Queues and Topics now enables you to edit runtime properties for these entities. We also allow you enable/disable Queues and Topics at the granularity of Send and Receive states:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7A1D6DFC.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1555C6FE.png\" width=\"860\" height=\"596\" /></a> </p>  <p>We have also added more dashboard metrics for Queues, Topics and Subscriptions. These include additions to operation counts and error counts.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_4989F044.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_36D4F68D.png\" width=\"819\" height=\"288\" /></a> </p>  <p>We have also significantly enhanced the content on the QUICK START page as well as provided the ability to download sample solutions that shows off how to build apps that use Service Bus Queues, Topics and Relays.</p>  <h2><u>Storage Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>You can now download blob storage files (even private blobs in your account) directly from within the Windows Azure Management Portal.&#160; From your storage account management page, go to the <b>CONTAINERS </b>tab to list your containers.&#160; Then click on the container name to go to the blob listing.&#160; You can select any blob and click the <b>DOWNLOAD BLOB </b>command on the command bar to download it directly from the browser:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_520D4F8E.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6D45A88F.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"426\" /></a> </p>  <p>Clicking this button will generate a temporary URL using a shared access signature and will trigger a browser download in a new tab.&#160; </p>  <p>Another new enhancement is the ability to edit blob metadata and properties within the portal using the <b>EDIT BLOB</b> command:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_366B5449.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_039B4DD5.png\" width=\"838\" height=\"610\" /></a> </p>  <p>From this dialog, you can see all of the relevant blob properties and user defined metadata.&#160; You can also edit some properties such as the <b>Content Type</b> as well as all of the metadata key value pairs.</p>  <h2><u>Media Services Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>This week’s release includes several update to Windows Azure Media Services. </p>  <p><u>Monitoring Metrics for on-demand streaming</u></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services enables you to easily stream video on-demand (and soon live) from Windows Azure – without having to setup your own streaming server.&#160; With this week’s update the dashboard view of your media service now displays monitoring metrics for on-demand streaming:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5A933F89.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0EC768D0.png\" width=\"859\" height=\"515\" /></a> </p>  <p><u>Improved Content and Samples</u></p>  <p>With this week’s release we have also updated the Media Services quick start page and added some helpful links as well as some sample code snippets that you can easily copy and paste into your code to start integrating Windows Azure Media Service tasks (typically encoding and streaming video) into your existing solutions:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_70E8E4CE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6C063112.png\" width=\"860\" height=\"596\" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>For example, the “Upload a video programmatically” code snippet will show you how to programmatically upload a video file into your Windows Azure Media Services account (it even includes your account name + key in the snippet so that you can literally copy/paste to try it out):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1510D00F.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6240C99A.png\" width=\"748\" height=\"435\" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h2><u>Cloud Service Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>In previous versions of the Windows Azure Management Portal, you could only upload a certificate PFX file. We listened to you feedback – with this week’s release, the portal now also supports upload of just the public key of the certificate 9e.g. a *.cer certificate file).</p>  <h2><u>Localization in 5 Additional Languages</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release, we have added additional localization support for <b>5 NEW LANGUAGES</b>: Russian, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional.&#160; You can select the language you want to use from the globe icon on the top of the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_44624599.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_587B6222.png\" width=\"828\" height=\"474\" /></a> </p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Store Support in 22 New Countries</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release we have also expanded support for the Windows Azure Store to 33 countries (up from the previous 11 countries supported).&#160; The <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/01/23/windows-azure-store-new-add-ons-and-expanded-availability.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Store</a> is an awesome feature of Windows Azure and enables you to consume services from a variety of Microsoft and non-Microsoft services.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

Whether you use Web Forms, MVC, Web API, or any other ASP.NET technology, there is something in this update for you.&#160; </p>  <p><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282650\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to download and install it today! This ASP.NET and Web Tools update will also be included with the upcoming Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 (aka VS2012.2).</p>  <h2><u>Visual Studio Web Tooling Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, all of the ASP.NET templates have updated versions of jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Validation, Modernizr, Knockout, and other open source NuGet packages. Note: your existing projects will continue to use the older packages unless you update them. </p>  <p>Web site projects now have the same publish experience as web application projects, including new support for publishing to Windows Azure Web Sites. You can selectively publish files, update local to remote files or vice versa, and see the differences between local and remote files. </p>  <p>Visual Studio 2012 Page Inspector enhancements include JavaScript selection mapping and CSS live updates as you type. The JavaScript selection mapping enables Page Inspector to map items that were dynamically added to the page back to the corresponding JavaScript code. For more information, read <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2012/12/14/css-auto-sync-and-javascript-selection-mapping-in-page-inspector.aspx\">CSS Auto-Sync and JavaScript Selection Mapping in Page Inspector</a>. </p>  <p>The Visual Studio 2012 editor has several improvements. With today’s update VS now supports syntax highlighting for: </p>  <ul>   <li>CoffeeScript</li>    <li>Mustache</li>    <li>Handlebars</li>    <li>JsRender</li> </ul>  <p>The HTML editor provides Intellisense for Knockout bindings. There is even first-class support for editing LESS files, complete with syntax highlighting, Intellisense, and validation. The editor also supports pasting JSON as a .NET class. Copy any JSON data into the clipboard, use a Paste Special command to paste it into a C# or VB.NET code file, and Visual Studio will automatically generate .NET classes inferred from the JSON. </p>  <p>Mobile Emulator support adds extensibility hooks so that third-party emulators can be installed as a VSIX. The installed emulators will show up in the F5 dropdown, so that developers can preview their websites on a variety of mobile devices. Read more about this feature in Scott Hanselman’s blog entry on <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CrossBrowserDebuggingIntegratedIntoVisualStudioWithBrowserStack.aspx\">the new BrowserStack integration with Visual Studio</a>.</p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET Web API Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, ASP.NET Web API now provides support for OData endpoints that support both ATOM and JSON-light formats. With OData you get support for rich query semantics, paging, $metadata, CRUD operations, and custom actions over any data source. Read more about ASP.NET Web API OData support at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api\">http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api</a>. </p>  <p>New built-in tracing functionality now lets you easily diagnose problems with Web API whether you’re running in Visual Studio or on Windows Azure. Tracing output from Web API is automatically written to the Visual Studio output window, IntelliTrace, and any other trace listener that you would like, including Windows Azure Diagnostics. The output shows the full Web API pipeline for all requests, including any exceptions or errors that occur, what controller and action were selected, model binding, the format that was negotiated, and the response. </p>  <p>Updated Web API projects now contain a link to an automatically generated help page that shows how to call your web API. The help page shows all of your API endpoints, the HTTP verbs they support, parameters, and sample request and response messages. You can customize the help page as you like, including adding <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yaohuang1/archive/2012/12/10/asp-net-web-api-help-page-part-3-advanced-help-page-customizations.aspx\">documentation</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yaohuang1/archive/2012/12/02/adding-a-simple-test-client-to-asp-net-web-api-help-page.aspx\">test client functionality</a>.&#160; This makes it really easy to create documentation pages for developers calling your services.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_01225169.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3C098432.png\" width=\"476\" height=\"338\" /></a></p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET SignalR</u></h2>  <p>ASP.NET SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to your applications. Real-time web functionality is the ability to have server-side code push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available.</p>  <p>You may have heard of the HTML5 WebSocket API that enables efficient bidirectional communication between the browser and server. SignalR uses Websockets when it is supported by the browser and the server, and gracefully falls back to other techniques and technologies when it is not (best of all your application code can stay the same regardless of which is being used).</p>  <p>SignalR provides a simple API for creating server-to-client remote procedure calls (RPC) that call JavaScript functions in client browsers from server-side .NET code. SignalR also includes API for connection management (for instance, connect and disconnect events), grouping connections, and authorization.</p>  <p>Included in today’s release is Visual Studio 2012 template support for creating SignalR projects as well as adding SignalR support to existing Web Forms and MVC applications:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_76F0B6FB.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6D978278.png\" width=\"628\" height=\"354\" /></a></p>  <p>Read more about SignalR at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/signalr\">http://www.asp.net/signalr</a>.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET Web Forms Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>ASP.NET Friendly URLs enable you to remove the .aspx extension from your Web Forms pages, making your sites’ URLs look cleaner. You can also pass parameters to pages as segments of the URL. For example, instead of ProductDetails.aspx?id=5 you can have ProductsDetails/5. With Friendly URLs you can also easily support mobile devices by creating mobile versions of pages:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>YourPage.aspx</strong> – This is the page that will be rendered by default on a browser.</li>    <li><strong>YourPage.Mobile.aspx</strong> – This is the version of the page that will be rendered by default on a mobile browser.</li>    <li><strong>YourPage.<i>Device</i>.aspx</strong> – You can write your own code to map a user-agent string to a specific device name. For example, you could have pages for Windows Phone, iPhone, and Android devices.</li> </ul>  <h2><u>ASP.NET MVC Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>A new Facebook Application template makes writing Facebook Canvas applications using ASP.NET MVC really easy. In a few simple steps, you can create a Facebook application that gets data from a logged in user and integrates with their friends. The template includes a new library to take care of all the plumbing involved in building a Facebook app, including authentication, permissions, accessing Facebook data and more. This lets you focus on building the business logic in your app. The Facebook apps you can build with this new template are hosted on the web and displayed inside the Facebook chrome via an iframe. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_721093F0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2162097B.png\" width=\"363\" height=\"485\" /></a></p>  <p><strong><u>Single Page Applications</u></strong></p>      <p>A new Single Page Application template for ASP.NET MVC is also now included and allows developers to build interactive client-side web apps using HTML 5, CSS 3, and the popular Knockout and jQuery JavaScript libraries – all on on top of ASP.NET Web API. </p>  <p>The default template creates a “todo” list application that demonstrates common practices for building a JavaScript HTML5 application that uses a RESTful server API. You can read more at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/single-page-application\">http://www.asp.net/single-page-application</a>.</p>  <p>If you don’t want to use the new Knockout template there are 4 new community-created templates. These templates were built using the improved <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/fall-2012-update/custom-mvc-templates\">Custom MVC Template</a> support:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282649\" target=\"_blank\">BreezeJS</a> template that uses BreezeJS and Knockout for data binding and templating</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282647\" target=\"_blank\">Ember</a> template uses the latest version of Ember and Handlebars</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282648\" target=\"_blank\">DurandalJS</a> template is built using the new MVVM library DurandalJS as well as Knockout</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282646\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Towel</a> uses BreezeJS, DurandalJS, Knockout, require.js and Bootstrap</li> </ul>  <p>You’ll see even more templates in the months ahead.</p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Authentication Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>A new pre-release of Windows Azure Authentication is also now available for MVC, Web Pages, and Web Forms. This feature enables your application to authenticate Office 365 users from your organization, corporate accounts synced from your on-premise Active Directory, or users created in your own custom Windows Azure Active Directory domain. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/fall-2012-update/windows-azure-authentication\">Windows Azure Authentication tutorial</a>.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>Today’s ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update has a lot of useful features for all developers using ASP.NET.&#160; Read the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=279941\" target=\"_blank\">release notes</a> to learn even more, and <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282650\" target=\"_blank\">install it</a> today!</p>  <p><strong><font color=\"#ff0000\">Important Installation Note</font></strong>: If you have installed an earlier version of Mads Kristensen’s excellent (and free) <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6\" target=\"_blank\">Web Essentials 2012 extension</a>, you’ll want to update it to the latest version before installing today’s ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update.&#160; The latest version of the <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6\" target=\"_blank\">Web Essentials 2012 extension</a> works well with today’s release – if you have an older version you will get a runtime error when you launch Visual Studio.&#160; Updating to the latest version of the extension prior to installing the ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update will fix this.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

[["author", "ScottGu"], ["content", "<p>During the BUILD 2012 conference we announced a new capability of Windows Azure: the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/overview/\">Windows Azure Store</a>. The Windows Azure Store makes it incredibly easy for you to discover, purchase, and provision premium add-on services, provided by our partners, for your cloud based applications. For example, you can use the Windows Azure Store to easily setup a MongoDB database in seconds, or quickly setup an analytics service like NewRelic that gives you deep insight into your application’s performance.</p>  <p>There is a growing list of app and data services now available through the Windows Azure Store, and the list is constantly expanding.&#160; Many services offered through the store include a free tier, which makes it incredibly easy for you to try them out with no obligation required.&#160; Services you decide to ultimately buy are automatically added to your standard Windows Azure bill – enabling you to add new capabilities to your applications without having to enter a credit card again nor setup a separate payment mechanism.&#160; </p>  <p>The Windows Azure Store is currently available to customers in 11 markets: US, UK, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Spain, and South Korea.&#160; Over the next few weeks we’ll be expanding the store to be available in even more countries and territories around the world.</p>  <h2><u>Signing up for an Add-On from the Windows Azure Store</u></h2>  <p>It is incredibly easy to start using a partner add-on from the Windows Azure store:</p>  <p>1) Sign-into the Windows Azure Management Portal</p>  <p>2) Click the New button (in the bottom-left corner) and then select the “Store” item within it:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_4EF1B32C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_42EFC2F8.png\" width=\"903\" height=\"470\" /></a></p>  <p>3) This will bring up UI that allows you to browse all of the partner add-ons available within the Store:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7DD6F5C1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_54CEE776.png\" width=\"828\" height=\"544\" /></a></p>  <p>You will see two categories of add-ons available: app services and data. Explore each to get an idea of the types of services available, and don’t forget to check back often, as the list is growing quickly!</p>  <p>4) Let’s try out a free app service from SendGrid, which lets you send e-mail from your application using a REST API or an SMTP server. Choose SendGrid from the list and click the next arrow.&#160; This will display more information about SendGrid, as well as a variety of plan options.&#160; Note that they offer a Free plan that allows you to send 6,000 emails/month, and then paid plans with more features and scale:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_68E803FF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2AEE7341.png\" width=\"812\" height=\"532\" /></a></p>  <p>5) Let’s select the free plan and click the next arrow.&#160; Doing so will display the final screen – which shows us how much this purchase will cost.&#160; In this case it will cost nothing.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1AE2353B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_15FF817F.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"537\" /></a></p>  <p>6) Click the “Purchase” button to complete the transaction (and if it was a non-free plan add it to your Windows Azure bill automatically).&#160; Once you click Purchase, SendGrid will provision an account for you and then you are ready to use it.&#160; No additional sign-up/billing steps required.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Using an Add-On from the Windows Azure Store</u></h2>  <p>The Windows Azure Management portal makes it really easy to track and manage the add-on services you sign-up for.&#160; Once the above steps are completed, the SendGrid service will show up in the list of “add ons” for your account.&#160; Click the “add-ons” tab within the portal to display and manage these:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_3F0A207B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_01108FBD.png\" width=\"875\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>  <p>Clicking on the SendGrid item will display information about the service – including details on how many emails I’ve used from my 200/day quota for the free tier:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5C12CF43.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_65026182.png\" width=\"876\" height=\"488\" /></a></p>  <p>A row of buttons at the bottom of the page lets you interact with the add-on:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>Manage</b> opens a new browser tab and signs you into the provider’s own admin portal without requiring you to enter a username or password (we automatically use single-sign-on with your azure account). For example, SendGrid’s admin portal lets you view statistics about email delivery and bounce rates. </li>    <li><b>Connection Info</b> provides you with the security credentials necessary to programmatically connect to the add-on’s service. For example, SendGrid provides an SMTP server, username and password which can be used directly within your application to send e-mail. </li>    <li><b>Upgrade </b>lets<b> </b>you upgrade your plan from free to a higher paid tier. </li>    <li><b>Contact settings</b> let you manage whether the provider can contact you with promotional materials.

Notification Hubs provide a common API to send push notifications to multiple device platforms.&#160; Your app can send notifications in platform specific formats or in a platform-independent way.&#160; As of January 2013, Notification Hubs are able to push notifications to Windows 8 apps and iOS apps.&#160; Support for Android and Windows Phone will be added soon. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li>     <p><strong>Efficient Pub/Sub Routing and Tag-based Multicast</strong>. Notification Hubs are optimized to enable push notification broadcast to thousands or millions of devices with low latency.&#160; Your server back-end can fire one message into a Notification Hub, and thousands/millions of push notifications can automatically be delivered to your users.&#160; Devices and apps can specify a number of <em>per-user</em> <em>tags</em> when registering with a Notification Hub. These tags do not need to be pre-provisioned or disposed, and provide a very easy way to send filtered notifications to an infinite number of users/devices with a single API call.&#160; Since tags can contain any app-specific string (e.g. user ids, favorite sports teams, stock symbols to track, location details, etc), their use effectively frees the app back-end from the burden of having to store and manage device handles or implement their own per-user notification routing information.&#160; </p>   </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li>     <p><b>Extreme Scale</b>. Notification Hubs enable you to reach millions of devices without you having to re-architect or shard your application.&#160; The pub/sub routing mechanism allows you to broadcast notifications in a super efficient way.&#160; This makes it incredibly easy to route and deliver notification messages to millions of users without having to build your own routing infrastructure.</p>   </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Usable from any Backend App</b>. Notification Hubs can be easily integrated into any back-end server app.&#160; It will work seamlessly with apps built with Windows Azure Mobile Services.&#160; It can also be used by server apps hosted within IaaS Virtual Machines (either Windows or Linux), Cloud Services or Web-Sites.&#160; This makes it easy for you to take advantage of it immediately without having to change the rest of your backend app architecture.</li> </ul>  <h2><u>Try Notification Hubs Today</u></h2>  <p> You can try the new Notification Hub support in Windows Azure by creating a new Notification Hub within the Windows Azure Management Portal – you can create one by selecting the <em>Service Bus Notification Hub</em> item under the “App Services” category in the <strong>New</strong> dialog:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1AB39405.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4352000C.png\" width=\"891\" height=\"644\" /></a></p>  <p>Creating a new Notification Hub takes less than a minute, and once created you can drill into it to see a dashboard view of activity with it.&#160; Among other things it allows you to see how many devices have been registered with it, how many messages have been pushed to it, how many messages have been successfully delivered via it, and how many have failed:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_39F8CB89.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2DF6DB55.png\" width=\"879\" height=\"575\" /></a></p>  <p>You can then click the “Configure” tab to register your Notification Hub with Microsoft’s Windows Notification System and Apple’s APNS service (we’ll add Android support in a future update):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_64D3C04C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_26DA2F8E.png\" width=\"879\" height=\"575\" /></a></p>  <p>Once this is setup, its simple to register any client app/device with a Notification Hub (optionally associating “tags” with them so that you can have the Notification Hub automatically filter for you who gets which messages).&#160; You can then broadcast messages to your users/mobile apps with only a few lines of code.</p>  <p>For example, below is some code that you could implement within your server back-end app to broadcast a message to all Windows 8 users registered with your Notification Hub:</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 8pt 0.5in;

The Notification Hub will automatically handle the pub/sub scale-out infrastructure necessary to scale your message to any number of registered device listeners in a low-latency way without you having to worry about implementing any of that scale-out logic yourself (nor block on this happening within your own code).&#160;

This release is now live in production, supported by a <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">new media services dev center</a>, backed by an enterprise SLA, and is ready to be used for all media projects.</p>  <p>With today’s release, you now have everything you need to quickly build great, extremely scalable, end-to-end media solutions for streaming on-demand video to consumers on any device.&#160; For example, you can easily build a media service for delivering training videos to employees in your company, stream video content for your web-site, or build a premium video-on-demand service like Hulu or Netflix.&#160; Last year several broadcasters used Windows Azure Media Services to <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/08/21/windows-azure-media-services-and-the-london-2012-olympics.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">stream the London 2012 Olympics</a>.</p>  <h2><u>Media Platform as a Service </u></h2>  <p>With Windows Azure Media Services, you can stream video to HTML5, Flash, Silverlight, Windows 8, iPad, iPhone, Android, Xbox, Windows Phone and other clients using a wide variety of streaming formats:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_30781B63.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2E3E2358.png\" width=\"845\" height=\"236\" /></a></p>  <p>Building a media solution that encodes and streams video to various devices and clients is a complex task.&#160; It requires hardware and software that has to be connected, configured, and maintained.&#160; Windows Azure Media Services makes this problem much easier by eliminating the need to provision and manage your own custom infrastructure.&#160; Windows Azure Media Services accomplishes this by providing you with a Media Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enables you to easily scale your business as it grows, and pay only for what you use. </p>  <p>As a developer, you can control Windows Azure Media Services by using <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">REST APIs or .NET and Java SDKs</a> to build a media workflow that can automatically upload, encode and deliver video.&#160; We’ve also developed a broad set of client SDKs and player frameworks which let you build completely custom video clients that integrate in your applications.&#160; This allows you to configure and control every aspect of the video playback experience, including inserting pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll, and overlay advertisement into your content.</p>  <h2><u>Upload, Encode, Deliver, Consume</u></h2>  <p>A typical video workflow involves uploading raw video to storage, encoding &amp; protecting the content, and then streaming that content to users who can consume it on any number of devices.&#160; For each of these major steps, we’ve built a number of features that you’ll find useful:</p>  <p><b><u>Upload</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services supports multiple different options to upload assets into Media Services:</p>  <ol>   <li>Using REST APIs, or .NET or Java SDKs you can upload files to the server over HTTP/S with AES 256 encryption.&#160; This works well for smaller sets of files and is for great uploading content on a day to day basis. </li>    <li><a href=\"http://blog-ndrouin.azurewebsites.net/?p=561\">Bulk upload</a> an entire media library with thousands of large files.&#160; Uploading large asset files can be a bottleneck for asset creation and by using a bulk ingesting approach, you can save a lot of time.&#160; For bulk upload, you can use the Bulk Ingest .NET Library or a partner upload solution such as <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/service/?name=aspera\" target=\"_blank\">Aspera</a> which uses UDP for transporting files at very rapid speeds.&#160; </li>    <li>If you already have content in Windows Azure blob storage, we also support blob to blob transfers and storage account to storage account transfers.&#160; </li>    <li>We also enable to you to upload content through the Windows Azure Portal – which is useful for small jobs or when first getting started.</li> </ol>  <p><b><u>Encode and then Deliver</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services provides built-in support for encoding media into a variety of different file-formats.&#160; With Windows Azure Media Services, you don’t need to buy or configure custom media encoding software or infrastructure – instead you can simply send REST calls (or use the .NET or Java SDK) to automate kicking off encoding jobs that Windows Azure Media Services will process and scale for you.</p>  <p>Last month, I <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/12/21/great-updates-to-windows-azure-mobile-services-web-sites-sql-data-sync-acs-media-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> we added <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/12/21/great-updates-to-windows-azure-mobile-services-web-sites-sql-data-sync-acs-media-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reserved capacity encoding support to Media Service</a> which gives you the ability to scale up the number of encoding tasks you can process in parallel. Using the SCALE page within the Windows Azure Portal, you can add reserved encoding units that let you encode multiple tasks concurrently (giving you faster encode jobs and predictable performance).&#160; </p>  <p>Today, we have also added new reserved capacity support for on-demand streaming (giving you more origin server capacity) - which can also now be provisioned on the same SCALE page in the management portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_502985DC.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3FB114E1.png\" width=\"755\" height=\"499\" /></a></p>  <p>In addition to giving your video service more origin streaming capacity to handle a greater number of concurrent users consuming different video content, our on-demand streaming support also now gives you a cool new feature we call <em>dynamic packaging</em>.</p>  <p>Traditionally, once content has been encoded, it needs to be packaged and stored for multiple targeted clients (iOS, XBox, PC, etc.).&#160; This traditional packaging process converts multi-bitrate MP4 files into multi-bitrate HLS file-sets or multi-bitrate Smooth Streaming files.&#160; This triples the storage requirements and adds significant processing cost and delay.</p>  <p>With dynamic packaging, we now allow users to store a single file format and stream to many adaptive protocol formats automatically.&#160; The packaging and conversion happens in real-time on the origin server which results in significant storage cost and time savings:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1CEFDD24.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3A64BEE1.png\" width=\"833\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>  <p>Today the source formats can be multi-bitrate MP4 or Smooth based, and these can be converted dynamically to either HLS or Smooth.&#160; The pluggable nature of this architecture will allow us, over the next few months, to also add DASH Live Profile streaming of fragmented MP-4 segments using time-based indexing as well.&#160; The support of HLS and the addition of DASH enables an ecosystem-friendly model based on common and standards-based streaming protocols, and ensures that you can target any type of device. </p>  <p><b><u>Consume</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services provides a large set of client player SDKs for all major devices and platforms, and they let you not only reach any device with a format that’s best suited for that device - but also build a custom player experience that uniquely integrates into your product or service.</p>  <p>Your users can consume media assets by building rich media applications rapidly on many platforms, such as Windows, iOS, XBox, etc.&#160; At this time, we ship <a href=\"http://mingfeiy.com/client-ecosystem-for-windows-azure-media-services/\">SDKs and player frameworks</a> for:</p>  <ul>   <li>Windows 8 </li>    <li>iOS </li>    <li>Xbox</li>    <li>Flash Player (built using Adobe OSMF) </li>    <li>Silverlight</li>    <li>Windows Phone</li>    <li>Android </li>    <li>Embedded devices (Connected TV, IPTV)</li> </ul>  <p>To get started with developing players, visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Developer tools for Windows Azure Media Services</a>. The SDKs and player frameworks contain player samples that you can use as-is or customize with very little effort. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_42E81E2B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4931856A.png\" width=\"613\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>  <h2><b><u>Start Today</u></b></h2>  <p>I’m really excited about today’s the general availability (GA) release of Windows Azure Media Services.&#160; This release is now live in production, backed by an enterprise SLA, and is ready to be used for all projects.&#160; It makes building great media solutions really easy and very cost effective.</p>  <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/media/\">Windows Azure Media Services page</a> to learn more about the capabilities, and visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Media Service Dev Center</a> for tutorials, how-to articles, blogs, and more information and get started building applications with it today!</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

[["author", "ScottGu"], ["content", "<p>This morning we released a number of enhancements to Windows Azure.&#160; These new capabilities include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Mobile Services (job scheduler support, Europe Region Support, Command Line Support) </li>    <li>Web Sites (scale improvements, integrated source control) </li>    <li>SQL Data Sync (support in the new HTML portal) </li>    <li>ACS Management (support in the new HTML portal) </li>    <li>Media Services (job and task management, blob storage support, reserved compute) </li>    <li>Virtual Network enhancements </li>    <li>Subscription Filtering Support </li>    <li>Windows Azure Store (now available in more countries) </li> </ul>  <p>All of these improvements are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; Below are more details on them:</p>  <h2><u>Mobile Services </u></h2>  <p>Windows Azure Mobile Services now supports the ability to easily schedule background jobs (aka CRON jobs) that execute on a pre-set timer interval, and which can run independently of a device accessing the service (ensuring that you don’t block or slow-down any requests from your users).&#160; This job scheduler functionality allows you to perform a variety of useful scenarios without having to create or manage a separate VM.&#160; Some of the scenarios you can enable with it include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Periodically purging old/duplicate data from your tables. </li>    <li>Periodically querying and aggregating data from external web service (tweets, RSS entries, location information) and cache it in your tables for subsequent use. </li>    <li>Periodically processing/resizing images submitted by users of your service. </li>    <li>Scheduling the sending of push notifications or SMS messages to your customers to ensure they arrive at the right time of the day. </li> </ul>  <p>Using today’s release you can now easily register background tasks by navigating to the new <b>Scheduler</b> tab of your mobile service in the Windows Azure portal, and then by clicking the <strong>Create</strong> button:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_0AFBFE83.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5EDF0191.png\" width=\"836\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>  <p>Doing this enables you to name a new job, and select how often you want to run it (note: you can also change the schedule later on):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2EB7B6CE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_09B9F655.png\" width=\"836\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>  <p>Once a job is created, you can drill into it and select the <b>Script </b>tab to author the server script you want to be executed on a recurring interval.&#160; As an example, the below script fetches Twitter updates about “red polos” and sends out a push notification from the mobile service: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5992AB91.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_64BEC68C.png\" width=\"865\" height=\"560\" /></a></p>  <p>Once you’ve entered the script, you can save and then click the <b>Run Once</b> button to execute a trial run. The <b>Run Once</b> functionality lets you easily test your job script before you enable the job for recurring execution.&#160; To enable recurring execution of the job, click either the <strong>Enable </strong>button within the script-view or go back to the <b>Scheduler</b> tab, select the job, and click the <strong>Enable </strong>button to activate it.</p>  <p>This new job scheduler capability makes it incredibly easy to integrate background work within your Mobile Service (without having to create or manage a separate VM to run it in).&#160; It can be used by all Mobile Service (even the free-tier level).&#160; The free-tier of Mobile Services includes support that allows you to run one background job every hour.&#160; If you upgrade your mobile service to have a reserved instance you can run up to 10 jobs every 15 minutes.</p>  <p>Check-out the Windows Azure Mobile Services documentation for an even more in-depth <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/schedule-backend-tasks/\">job scheduler tutorial</a>.</p>  <p><u>Mobile Service Region Support in Europe</u></p>  <p>Before today, our preview of Windows Azure Mobile Services was only supported in the US East and US West regions of Windows Azure.&#160; With this week’s update you can now also create Mobile Services in the North Europe region as well. As with every Windows Azure service, over time we will extend Mobile Services to all Windows Azure regions world-wide:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_53DA229C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0F2D885B.png\" width=\"559\" height=\"371\" /></a></p>  <p><u>Mobile Service Command Line Support</u></p>  <p>Earlier this year we released a cross-platform Windows Azure Command Line Tool (a.k.a ‘azure’) that allows you to manage Windows Azure Web Sites, VMs and other services from the command line on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can learn more about it <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/command-line-tools/\">here</a>.&#160; Today we have released an update for this tool that adds support for Windows Azure Mobile Services as well.&#160; To get started, install the ‘azure’ tool for <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=275464&amp;clcid=0x409\">Windows</a> or <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=253471&amp;clcid=0x409\">Mac</a>. </p>  <p>If you haven’t used the tool before, you need to perform a one-time step and download/import the Windows Azure management credentials for your account. In a command prompt run the following command to download Windows Azure publish settings:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure account download</font></p>  <p>then import the .publishsettings file you just downloaded:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure account import &quot;C:\\temp\\my-credentials.publishsettings&quot;</font></p>  <p>Once you do this you’ll be able to access your Windows Azure subscription and perform operations against it entirely from the command-line.&#160; For example, using today’s update we can now create a new Window Azure Mobile Service entirely from the command-line (no portal interaction required at all):</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile create scottgucli</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_786E40D1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_05D453D8.png\" width=\"681\" height=\"263\" /></a></p>  <p>And with that simple command we now have a newly created Windows Azure Mobile Service!</p>  <p>Creating new tables with the mobile service can likewise now be done entirely from the command-line:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile table create scottgucli products</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6C6C509D.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_19ED7061.png\" width=\"681\" height=\"167\" /></a></p>  <p>Many users have asked for the ability to directly upload scripts from their file system (without having to go through the portal) and the new CLI support makes this really easy. For example, to upload an “insert” script for the products table we just created above you can use the following command:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile script upload scottgucli table/products.insert -f c:\\code\\products.js</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_20A079E4.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_27538367.png\" width=\"841\" height=\"191\" /></a></p>  <p>Now this script will run every time a record is inserted into the products table.</p>  <h2><u>Web Sites</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release we have increased the scaling capabilities of our Windows Azure Web Sites service.&#160; </p>  <p>Previously a web-site could only be scaled up to run across 3 shared instances or 3 reserved VMs.&#160; With today’s release we now support the ability for you to scale up a web-site to run across 6 shared instances (beyond which it is cheaper to switch to a reserved instance):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5BF3DFA2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6B967B64.png\" width=\"826\" height=\"493\" /></a></p>  <p>With today’s release we also now support the ability for you to scale up a web-site to run across 10 reserved VM instances (where you are guaranteed to be the only customer using those VMs).&#160; You can use either Small, Medium, or Large sized VMs when doing this:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_090B5D22.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;

Choose the <strong>NEW-&gt;Website-&gt;Custom Create</strong> command to try this out:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2F039E29.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;

SQL Data Sync lets you synchronize data between multiple SQL databases.&#160; These SQL databases can span across your on-premises environment and the cloud, or across multiple cloud hosted databases (for example: within multiple Windows Azure regions around the world).&#160; It is a very powerful capability that can enable a variety of interesting scenarios.</p>  <p>To use SQL Data Sync, go to the SQL Databases section of the new Windows Azure Management Portal and click on the new <strong>ADD SYNC </strong>command in the bottom tray of it:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40768FB2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;

Give it a name.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_693C37BF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7DC1873D.png\" width=\"610\" height=\"418\" /></a></p>  <p>2. Choose the hub database, and provide connection credentials.&#160; The hub database is the central database within the group and must be a SQL Database in Windows Azure: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40342974.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_349E6C35.png\" width=\"607\" height=\"415\" /></a></p>  <p>3. Then add a reference database, and provide connection credentials.&#160; Think of reference databases as “spoke” or “member” databases that connect with the hub database.&#160; They can be any combination of on-premise SQL Servers or other Windows Azure SQL Databases.&#160; They can sync bi-directionally with the hub, to the hub, or from the hub:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_14172C83.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_561D9BC4.png\" width=\"692\" height=\"481\" /></a></p>  <p>Once you’ve completed the above steps, your sync group is setup. </p>  <p><b><u>DEFINING SYNC RULES</u></b></p>  <p>You can now drill into the sync group to define your sync rules, manage the reference databases, add new reference databases, configure sync settings, and view historical sync logs.&#160; Note that you must define your sync rules via the <b>SYNC RULES </b>tab before syncing will begin.&#160; These rules determine the tables, columns, and even the rows that will be involved in the sync. You will want to choose the rules based on the needs of the application. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7F283AC0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1A6093C2.png\" width=\"654\" height=\"356\" /></a></p>  <p><b><u>CONFIGURING SYNC</u></b></p>  <p>Once the sync rules have been defined, the sync group can be synchronized, either on demand using the <b>SYNC</b> button or on regular scheduled interval.&#160; Use the <b>CONFIGURE</b> tab to setup a sync schedule to have the synchronization happen automatically.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_07AB9A0B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_22E3F30C.png\" width=\"654\" height=\"506\" /></a></p>  <p>Once setup, your databases will automatically synchronize.&#160; This can work either between your on-premises environment and the cloud, or between multiple cloud databases (for example: within multiple Windows Azure regions around the world).&#160; It is a very powerful capability that can enable a variety of compelling scenarios.</p>  <h2><u>Active Directory Access Control Management (ACS) Support</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, you can also now create and manage Windows Azure Active Directory Access Control namespaces from the new Windows Azure Management Portal. </p>  <p>Windows Azure AD Access Control is a service that lets you authenticate and authorize users for your web applications and services, while allowing authentication and authorization features to be factored out of your code. ACS works with standards-based identity providers, including enterprise directories such as Active Directory, and web identities such as Windows Live ID, Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook. For more information, see Windows Azure AD <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=272724\">Access Control</a>.</p>  <p><u>Creating an ACS Namespace</u></p>  <p>To create an Access Control namespace, click <b>NEW </b>in the Windows Azure Management Portal, and select <b>APP SERVICES</b> <b>-&gt; ACCESS CONTROL -&gt;QUICK CREATE</b>.&#160; In the namespace field, type the name of the Access Control namespace that you want to create:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40C507BE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5BFD60BF.png\" width=\"873\" height=\"289\" /></a></p>  <p><u>Managing a Namespace</u></p>  <p>To manage an Access Control namespace, click on the new <strong>Active Directory </strong>node in the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_49486708.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1201DFCD.png\" width=\"845\" height=\"470\" /></a></p>  <p>Then, select the namespace you want to manage, and click the <b>MANAGE</b> button in the command bar at the bottom of the screen.&#160; This will open the ACS Management Portal.&#160; You can additionally move your ACS namespaces from one subscription to another via the <b>CHANGE SUBSCRIPTION</b> command in the bottom of the page. </p>  <p>For more information about other recent enhancements that make Windows Azure AD more useful for developers, read Alex Simons’ blog post <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/07/enhancements-to-windows-azure-active-directory-preview.aspx\">here</a>, and Bill Hilf’s post <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/27/windows-azure-active-directory-processes-200-billion-authentications-connecting-people-data-and-devices-around-the-globe.aspx\">here</a>.&#160; Even more Active Directory functionality will be integrated within the Windows Azure Portal next year.</p>  <h2><u>Media Service Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>Today’s release contains a number of great enhancements to Windows Azure Media Services.&#160; This release includes investments to:</p>  <ul>   <li>Job and Task management </li>    <li>Adding content from a Windows Azure storage account </li>    <li>Scaling your media services account to increase encoding concurrency </li> </ul>  <p><u>Job and Task Management</u></p>  <p>You can now track the progress and history of your media encoding jobs from within the Windows Azure Portal.&#160; The new <b>JOBS</b> tab within the Media Services extension lets you define custom queries for jobs by status, timeframe, or Job Id:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_21A47B8F.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_25B15A12.png\" width=\"838\" height=\"658\" /></a></p>  <p>The results of your queries will appear below the query editor.&#160; You can expand jobs to see information about the tasks that make up the job giving you deeper insight into each individual job and determine where things are progressing as planned or might require attention. You can also select a job within the list to either cancel the job or view details including errors related to the tasks.</p>  <p><b><u>Adding Content from Windows Azure Storage</u></b></p>  <p>Prior to this release, the only way to get content into your media services account was to write code using the Azure Media SDK, or upload a file within the portal from your local computer.&#160; Today we are introducing a new feature within the Windows Azure Portal that lets you choose existing media files from Windows Azure Blob Storage, thereby reducing your upload latency.&#160; From the <b>CONTENT </b>tab within the Media Services extension, you can select the <b>UPLOAD </b>command.&#160; </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_70A75B92.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_792ABADC.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>  <p>Notice the file browser now offers a <b>FROM STORAGE </b>option in addition to the previous “FROM LOCAL” support we already shipped.&#160; Note that the 200 MB limit mentioned in the header only applies to the <b>FROM LOCAL</b> option.&#160; Files sizes in the tens of gigabytes are supported via the <b>FROM STORAGE </b>option:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2F9B6CDF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_643BC91A.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"448\" /></a></p>  <p>The <b>FROM STORAGE</b> option will open the storage browser; you will be able to select a media file from blob storage from here.&#160; </p>  <p><b><u>Reserved Capacity for Media Service Jobs</u></b></p>  <p>With today’s release we have also added a new capability that allows you to scale up the number of encoding tasks you are processing.&#160; By default, we only support having one active encoding task at a time.&#160; Using the new <b>SCALE</b> page, you can reserve encoding units that let you encode multiple tasks concurrently and have even more processing power reserved for your media workflows:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_31D7F59B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_73DE64DC.png\" width=\"803\" height=\"369\" /></a></p>  <h2><u>Virtual Networking Simplifications</u></h2>  <p>Based on customer feedback, we have significantly simplified the virtual network creation workflow within the Windows Azure Portal.&#160; In an earlier release, we had introduced a “Quick Create” workflow that simplified the most common virtual networking scenarios. In this release, we have further simplified the “Custom Create” experience to make creating more advanced scenarios easier as well.

Some users have one subscription for each department in their company; others have one for each environment (development, testing, and production).&#160; Some users even have one for each external customer that they work with.&#160; Regardless of which category you fall into, you might find that managing all of the resources across all subscriptions can be challenging, difficult to navigate, and can result in a sluggish experience.</p>  <p>Starting today a new <strong>subscription</strong> filter UI now appears next to your user name in the top right-hand side of the Windows Azure portal to help filter your views by one or more subscriptions.&#160; Selecting it will display a drop-down list that enables you to quickly filter which subscriptions you want to see in the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_0A5B4628.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1C3A6AA6.png\" width=\"812\" height=\"514\" /></a></p>  <p>By default, all of your subscriptions are selected and loaded into the portal.&#160; Using the dropdown, you can now pick and choose exactly which subscriptions you want to manage.&#160; This will provide a few noticeable benefits: </p>  <ul>   <li>Resources associated with hidden subscriptions are <b>filtered out</b> of all the experiences across the portal. </li>    <li>Your filter selection <b>roams with you across sessions and devices</b>.&#160; If you set a filter on your laptop it will take affect when you return to your desktop or mobile device. </li>    <li>Users with many subscriptions will notice a <b>significant performance improvement</b> when loading only a small subset of their subscriptions since data for subscriptions that are filtered out is never loaded. </li> </ul>  <p>Note: If you only have one subscription, this change doesn’t affect you one bit.&#160; Your experience remains unchanged.&#160; In fact, you’ll only see the subscription filter UI show-up if you have more than subscription.</p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Store Now Available in More Countries</u></h2>  <p>This week we have also expanded the number of countries that the Windows Azure Store is available within (previously it was only available in the United States).&#160; The Windows Azure Store enables you to easily subscribe to services provided by 3rd party partners of ours – and have them automatically added to your Windows Azure bill.&#160; It is an incredibly cool capability – and one I’ll be blogging a lot more about shortly.</p>  <p>In the mean-time, try it out by selecting the <strong>New-&gt;Store</strong> command within the portal and sign-up for one of the services in it today.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; Below are more details on them:If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

These new capabilities include:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Mobile Services</strong>: HTML5/JS (CORS) Client + PhoneGap + Windows Phone 7.5 + .NET Portable Library support </li>    <li><strong>Web Sites</strong>: Mercurial Source Control + Dropbox Deployment support </li>    <li><strong>HDInsight</strong>: New service that enables you to easily deploy and manage Hadoop Clusters on Azure </li> </ul>  <p>All of these improvements are now available to start using immediately (note: some services are still in preview). Below are more details on them:</p>  <h2><u>Mobile Services: HTML5/JS Client (CORS), PhoneGap, Windows Phone 7.5</u></h2>  <p>Today we are adding support to enable pure HTML5/JS clients (and PhoneGap apps) as well as Windows Phone 7.5 clients to use Windows Azure Mobile Services as a backend.&#160; This comes in addition to the new <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/03/04/windows-azure-updates-android-support-sql-reporting-services-active-directory-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Android SDK for Windows Azure Mobile Services</a> we released two weeks ago (as well as the Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and iOS support we had earlier). </p>  <p><u><strong>HTML5/JS Clients</strong></u></p>  <p>You can now connect both HTML5 web client apps as well as Apache Cordova/PhoneGap apps to your Mobile Services, and use Windows Azure for both data storage and authentication.&#160; We are delivering this via:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>New Mobile Services web client library</b> that supports IE8+ browsers, current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, plus PhoneGap 2.3.0+. It offers the same data querying and storage APIs support we have in other native SDKs, and allows easy user authentication via any of the four identity providers supported by Mobile Services (Microsoft Account, Google, Facebook, and Twitter). Please use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services/issues\">GitHub issue tracker</a> to report any issues, and <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/\">our forum</a> to get help. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support</b> to enable your Mobile Service to accept cross-domain Ajax requests. You can now configure a whitelist of allowed domains for your Mobile Service using the Windows Azure management portal. </li> </ul>  <p>To get started, create a mobile service in the <a href=\"http://manage.windowsazure.com\">Windows Azure Management Portal</a> and open the Quickstart tab. You can now select “HTML” and find the steps to create a new HTML5/JS client or add a backend to an existing one: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_71F2F2B0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_338D2EFD.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"478\" /></a> </p>  <p>You can then continue with <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-html/\">this tutorial</a> for the remaining steps and build a simple HTML5 todo list app (that runs entirely in a browser) in under 5 minutes. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_38064075.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_13087FFC.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"293\" /></a> </p>  <p>When deploying the HTML5 front-end app to a production environment, make sure to add the host name of the website you use to host it to your Windows Azure Mobile Services’ Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) whitelist using the <strong>Configure</strong> tab as shown below:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6E0ABF82.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_04CC97BD.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"478\" /></a> </p>  <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/mobile\">Windows Azure Mobile dev center</a> and read <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-html/\">this tutorial</a> to learn more about working with server-side data, or <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-html/\">this one</a> if you want to learn more about authenticating users.</p>  <p><strong><u>Windows Phone 7.5 Support and a new C# Client Library on NuGet</u></strong></p>  <p>A few days ago we published a <a href=\"http://nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.MobileServices/0.3.0-alpha\">preview of our next version of the Mobile Services C# client library</a> on NuGet.&#160; The goal of this pre-release is to give Mobile Services developers an early look at the new features we are planning for our next C# SDK update and an opportunity to try them out ahead of time. Some of the great new features we have added include:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>Portable Library Support</b>: We have consolidated our Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 clients on top of a single codebase using Portable Libraries. This enables us to reach a variety of new client platforms, as well as enable you to call Mobile Services from your ASP.NET and .NET server backend. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Windows Phone 7.5 support:</b> With the move to Portable Libraries, we are also enabling support for Windows Phone 7.5</li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Json.NET and HttpClient: </b>We migrated our implementation to use the latest and most flexible HTTP components to enable maximum robustness and extensibility. </li> </ul>  <p>Note: Today’s drop is a pre-release. For production apps we recommend continuing to use the “stable” Mobile Service client libraries for .NET available for download <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/developer-tools/\">here</a>.&#160; </p>  <p><strong><u>Keep Giving Us Feedback</u></strong></p>  <p>Please continue to visit our <a href=\"https://mobileservices.uservoice.com/forums/182281-feature-requests/filters/top\" target=\"_blank\">uservoice</a> page to let us know what you’d like to see added next (today’s release added 3 of the top 5 asks in uservoice!). <a href=\"mailto:mobileservices@microsoft.com?subject=Windows%20Azure%20Mobile%20Services%20adds%20Android%20support,%20will%20deliver%20additional%20SDKs%20and%20extends%20availability%20to%20East%20Asia%20\">Email us</a> to show off your app, and ask questions in our <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/threads\">forum</a> whenever you run into a problem.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Web Sites: Mercurial and Dropbox Deployment Support</u></h2>  <p>Today’s release also includes a number of deployment/publishing enhancements to Windows Azure Web Sites:</p>  <p><strong><u>Mercurial Source Control Support</u></strong></p>  <p>You can now use Mercurial (Hg) repositories when setting up continuous deployment of your Websites from your CodePlex or Bitbucket repositories.&#160; This is in addition to the TFS, CodePlex, Git and GitHub source control provider support that we previously supported.&#160; </p>  <p>Today’s release also includes improved UI that makes it even easier to setup deployment from source-control.&#160; Simply click the “Setup deployment from source control” link on your web-site dashboard, and a new wizard will appear that makes it trivial to walkthrough setting up publishing endpoints using a variety of source control providers and sites.&#160; For example, below is how you could choose to enable source code deployment from a public or private Mercurial (Hg) repository you might have on Bitbucket:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_78CAA788.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0F8C7FC3.png\" width=\"688\" height=\"484\" /></a> </p>  <p><strong><u>Dropbox Deployment Support</u></strong></p>  <p>Windows Azure also now supports site/app deployment from Dropbox to Web sites, making website deployment as easy as copying files to a folder on your local computer.&#160; To enable this from the Windows Azure management portal, click the “Set up deployment from source control” link on your Web site dashboard, choose Dropbox and authorize the connection, and then choose a Dropbox sub-folder to synchronize: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_38971EBF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4186B0FE.png\" width=\"680\" height=\"476\" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>You can then simply copy your source files to the Dropbox sub-folder on your local computer and press the “Sync” button in the Windows Azure Portal to deploy the files.&#160; Windows Azure will automatically build sources as needed, similar to Git or TFS based deployments.&#160; Also, the deployment history tab in the portal will keep track of your deployments and enables you to re-deploy any previous deployment with the click of a button.</p>  <p>Watch this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC1xAjz6jHI&amp;hd=1\" target=\"_blank\">2 minute screencast</a> to see how easy it now is to deploy web sites to Windows Azure using Dropbox.</p>  <p><strong><u>Improved UI for Managing Source Control Deployments</u></strong></p>  <p>In addition to the new setup wizard for source control deployment, today’s Windows Azure release also includes some other nice enhancements to the source control UI.&#160; Deployment history in the management portal now accurately reflects which source control provider is connected for continuous deployment, such as TFS, CodePlex, GitHub, or Bitbucket.&#160; It is also now possible to disconnect from an already connected source provider on a web-site in order to set up a different one (previously you had to delete the site to do this).</p>  <p><strong><u>TFS Certificate Renewal</u></strong></p>  <p>It’s also now possible to renew the certificate used by Team Foundation Service for continuous deployment directly from the Windows Azure management portal. To do this, click the “Renew TFS certificate” link on either the Dashboard or Quick Start page.</p>  <p><strong><u>Support for Regenerating the Publish Profile</u></strong></p>  <p>Today you can download a publish profile from the Web Sites dashboard. Once that profile is downloaded, the credentials are basically good forever. We understand that this is not optimal. To address this, with today’s release we are introducing a new quick glance command in the dashboard called <b>Reset publish profile credentials</b>. When clicked, you will get a confirmation for resetting the credentials and the credentials are regenerated.</p>  <h2><u>New HDInsight Server: Deploy and Manage Hadoop Clusters on Azure</u></h2>  <p>Today we also <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286692\">released</a> a public preview of the new HDInsight Service for Windows Azure. HDInsight provides everything you need to quickly deploy, manage and use Hadoop clusters running on Windows Azure. </p>  <p>If you have a Windows Azure account you can <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286685\">request access</a> to the HDInsight Preview and then easily create an HDInsight cluster within the <a href=\"http://manage.windowsazure.com\">Windows Azure Management Portal</a>. Within the Windows Azure Management Portal click the New button and select the new HDInsight service to create a Hadoop cluster.&#160; Specify a name for the cluster, a password for logging into the cluster and the size of cluster you need:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_75BADA44.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_69B8EA10.png\" width=\"868\" height=\"580\" /></a> </p>  <p><em>Note: a storage account is required to create a cluster and in the current public preview the storage account must reside in the East US region. The Azure Storage account you associate with your cluster is where you will store the data that you will analyze in HDInsight.</em></p>  <p><strong><u>HDInsight Clusters</u></strong></p>  <p>A cluster will take a few minutes to create (as part of creating it will configure the necessary Virtual Machines that together make up your Hadoop cluster). The Hadoop components installed as part of an HDInsight cluster are outlined <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286746\">here</a>. Once the cluster is created, you can drill into the dashboard view to see the cluster quick glance screen. This quick glance allows you to see the basic information about your cluster and gives you a simple method to connect to the cluster (just click the <strong>Manage</strong> button at the bottom of the dashboard).</p>  <p>When you connect to the cluster you’ll see a page that contains a number of tiles that provide information about the cluster and can be used to perform additional tasks:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_75513800.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5B7D01D1.png\" width=\"649\" height=\"505\" /></a> </p>  <p>The <b>Create Job</b> tile opens a MapReduce job submission form that you can use to submit <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=287075\" target=\"_blank\">MapReduce</a> jobs as JAR files. The <b>Interactive Console</b> tile opens a console that lets you execute Javascript and <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/hdinsight/using-hive-with-hdinsight/\">Hive</a> queries directly against your cluster.&#160; The <strong>Samples</strong> title includes samples that you can use to get started.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it!</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

To get started, create a SQL Reporting service by selecting <b>NEW -&gt; SQL REPORTING -&gt; QUICK CREATE</b>. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7989FF01.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7BC687BD.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"354\" /></a> </p>  <p>Once created, the <b>QUICK START</b> tab provides useful information for you to get started including links to tools and helpful articles on MSDN: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_16FEE0BF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_59055000.png\" width=\"796\" height=\"474\" /></a> </p>  <p>You can monitor the average and maximum number of reports processed in the dashboard view of your SQL reporting service.&#160; You can add users and manage permissions using the Users and Items tabs.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h2><u>Active Directory Integration</u></h2>  <p>We have made some great improvements with this week’s release in bringing enterprise level identity management to Windows Azure.&#160; Companies who sign up for Windows Azure as organizations (by creating a new Windows Azure Active Directory or signing up for Windows Azure with their Office 365 identity) will now find several new capabilities in the Windows Azure Management Portal:</p>  <ul>   <li>Ability to create and manage user accounts in your Windows Azure Active Directory. </li>    <li>Phone based two factor authentication for users who are Global Administrators in Windows Azure AD.</li>    <li>Ability to sync users from an on-premise Active Directory.&#160; </li>    <li>Ability to establish single sign with Azure (and other Microsoft Services like Office 365) using Active Directory Federation Services.</li> </ul>  <p>The Active Directory tab within the Windows Azure Management Portal now allows you to see all directories that your account is managing, as well as create and manage users, domains and directory integration settings:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_54229C44.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1D4847FE.png\" width=\"856\" height=\"429\" /></a> </p>  <p>For a more detailed discussion of the new Active Directory support, read Alex Simons’ post on the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2013/02/26/more-identity-and-access-management-improvements-in-windows-azure.aspx\">Azure Blog</a>.&#160; You’ll see this AD support get even better in the months ahead.</p>  <h2><u>Availability Monitoring for Cloud Services, Websites, Mobile Services, and VMs</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release we are enabling a new preview feature that will let you monitor the availability of your web applications. Web availability monitoring helps you understand the response time and availability of your web application from different locations around the world. This feature is available for Websites and Mobile Services in reserved mode, Cloud services in production environment, and for Virtual Machines.</p>  <p>You can try the web endpoint monitoring support in Windows Azure and enable your http/https endpoints to be tested from different locations. For example, to monitor your Web Site, scale the Web Site to reserved mode and then navigate to the configure page for the Web Site. Within the configure page, navigate to the monitoring section:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6A784189.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1AA21CFE.png\" width=\"878\" height=\"292\" /></a> </p>  <p>The monitoring section allows you to add multiple URLs that you wish to monitor.&#160; Add a friendly name for each URL and select the locations around the world that you wish to monitor it from. With this week’s preview you can monitor the Web URL from up to 3 test locations. After you have saved the configuration, the Web Site’s URL will be tested once every 5 minutes from each of the configured locations.</p>  <p>The results of the tests can be viewed on the Web Site’s dashboard as well as from the monitoring tab:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_07ED2347.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6A0E9F45.png\" width=\"801\" height=\"425\" /></a> </p>  <p>Availability is monitored using HTTP response codes, and response time. The Web Site is considered down when the response time is greater than 30 seconds or the HTTP status code is greater than 400.&#160; </p>  <p>The same features are available for Virtual Machines, Mobile Services and Cloud Services (in Production slot).</p>  <h2><u>Service Bus Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With this release, we have added some nice new capabilities to the Service Bus experience. First, the new <b>CONFIGURATION</b> tabs for Queues and Topics now enables you to edit runtime properties for these entities. We also allow you enable/disable Queues and Topics at the granularity of Send and Receive states:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7A1D6DFC.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1555C6FE.png\" width=\"860\" height=\"596\" /></a> </p>  <p>We have also added more dashboard metrics for Queues, Topics and Subscriptions. These include additions to operation counts and error counts.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_4989F044.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_36D4F68D.png\" width=\"819\" height=\"288\" /></a> </p>  <p>We have also significantly enhanced the content on the QUICK START page as well as provided the ability to download sample solutions that shows off how to build apps that use Service Bus Queues, Topics and Relays.</p>  <h2><u>Storage Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>You can now download blob storage files (even private blobs in your account) directly from within the Windows Azure Management Portal.&#160; From your storage account management page, go to the <b>CONTAINERS </b>tab to list your containers.&#160; Then click on the container name to go to the blob listing.&#160; You can select any blob and click the <b>DOWNLOAD BLOB </b>command on the command bar to download it directly from the browser:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_520D4F8E.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6D45A88F.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"426\" /></a> </p>  <p>Clicking this button will generate a temporary URL using a shared access signature and will trigger a browser download in a new tab.&#160; </p>  <p>Another new enhancement is the ability to edit blob metadata and properties within the portal using the <b>EDIT BLOB</b> command:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_366B5449.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_039B4DD5.png\" width=\"838\" height=\"610\" /></a> </p>  <p>From this dialog, you can see all of the relevant blob properties and user defined metadata.&#160; You can also edit some properties such as the <b>Content Type</b> as well as all of the metadata key value pairs.</p>  <h2><u>Media Services Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>This week’s release includes several update to Windows Azure Media Services. </p>  <p><u>Monitoring Metrics for on-demand streaming</u></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services enables you to easily stream video on-demand (and soon live) from Windows Azure – without having to setup your own streaming server.&#160; With this week’s update the dashboard view of your media service now displays monitoring metrics for on-demand streaming:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5A933F89.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0EC768D0.png\" width=\"859\" height=\"515\" /></a> </p>  <p><u>Improved Content and Samples</u></p>  <p>With this week’s release we have also updated the Media Services quick start page and added some helpful links as well as some sample code snippets that you can easily copy and paste into your code to start integrating Windows Azure Media Service tasks (typically encoding and streaming video) into your existing solutions:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_70E8E4CE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6C063112.png\" width=\"860\" height=\"596\" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>For example, the “Upload a video programmatically” code snippet will show you how to programmatically upload a video file into your Windows Azure Media Services account (it even includes your account name + key in the snippet so that you can literally copy/paste to try it out):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1510D00F.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6240C99A.png\" width=\"748\" height=\"435\" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h2><u>Cloud Service Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>In previous versions of the Windows Azure Management Portal, you could only upload a certificate PFX file. We listened to you feedback – with this week’s release, the portal now also supports upload of just the public key of the certificate 9e.g. a *.cer certificate file).</p>  <h2><u>Localization in 5 Additional Languages</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release, we have added additional localization support for <b>5 NEW LANGUAGES</b>: Russian, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional.&#160; You can select the language you want to use from the globe icon on the top of the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_44624599.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_587B6222.png\" width=\"828\" height=\"474\" /></a> </p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Store Support in 22 New Countries</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release we have also expanded support for the Windows Azure Store to 33 countries (up from the previous 11 countries supported).&#160; The <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/01/23/windows-azure-store-new-add-ons-and-expanded-availability.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Store</a> is an awesome feature of Windows Azure and enables you to consume services from a variety of Microsoft and non-Microsoft services.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

Whether you use Web Forms, MVC, Web API, or any other ASP.NET technology, there is something in this update for you.&#160; </p>  <p><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282650\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to download and install it today! This ASP.NET and Web Tools update will also be included with the upcoming Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 (aka VS2012.2).</p>  <h2><u>Visual Studio Web Tooling Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, all of the ASP.NET templates have updated versions of jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Validation, Modernizr, Knockout, and other open source NuGet packages. Note: your existing projects will continue to use the older packages unless you update them. </p>  <p>Web site projects now have the same publish experience as web application projects, including new support for publishing to Windows Azure Web Sites. You can selectively publish files, update local to remote files or vice versa, and see the differences between local and remote files. </p>  <p>Visual Studio 2012 Page Inspector enhancements include JavaScript selection mapping and CSS live updates as you type. The JavaScript selection mapping enables Page Inspector to map items that were dynamically added to the page back to the corresponding JavaScript code. For more information, read <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2012/12/14/css-auto-sync-and-javascript-selection-mapping-in-page-inspector.aspx\">CSS Auto-Sync and JavaScript Selection Mapping in Page Inspector</a>. </p>  <p>The Visual Studio 2012 editor has several improvements. With today’s update VS now supports syntax highlighting for: </p>  <ul>   <li>CoffeeScript</li>    <li>Mustache</li>    <li>Handlebars</li>    <li>JsRender</li> </ul>  <p>The HTML editor provides Intellisense for Knockout bindings. There is even first-class support for editing LESS files, complete with syntax highlighting, Intellisense, and validation. The editor also supports pasting JSON as a .NET class. Copy any JSON data into the clipboard, use a Paste Special command to paste it into a C# or VB.NET code file, and Visual Studio will automatically generate .NET classes inferred from the JSON. </p>  <p>Mobile Emulator support adds extensibility hooks so that third-party emulators can be installed as a VSIX. The installed emulators will show up in the F5 dropdown, so that developers can preview their websites on a variety of mobile devices. Read more about this feature in Scott Hanselman’s blog entry on <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CrossBrowserDebuggingIntegratedIntoVisualStudioWithBrowserStack.aspx\">the new BrowserStack integration with Visual Studio</a>.</p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET Web API Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, ASP.NET Web API now provides support for OData endpoints that support both ATOM and JSON-light formats. With OData you get support for rich query semantics, paging, $metadata, CRUD operations, and custom actions over any data source. Read more about ASP.NET Web API OData support at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api\">http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api</a>. </p>  <p>New built-in tracing functionality now lets you easily diagnose problems with Web API whether you’re running in Visual Studio or on Windows Azure. Tracing output from Web API is automatically written to the Visual Studio output window, IntelliTrace, and any other trace listener that you would like, including Windows Azure Diagnostics. The output shows the full Web API pipeline for all requests, including any exceptions or errors that occur, what controller and action were selected, model binding, the format that was negotiated, and the response. </p>  <p>Updated Web API projects now contain a link to an automatically generated help page that shows how to call your web API. The help page shows all of your API endpoints, the HTTP verbs they support, parameters, and sample request and response messages. You can customize the help page as you like, including adding <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yaohuang1/archive/2012/12/10/asp-net-web-api-help-page-part-3-advanced-help-page-customizations.aspx\">documentation</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yaohuang1/archive/2012/12/02/adding-a-simple-test-client-to-asp-net-web-api-help-page.aspx\">test client functionality</a>.&#160; This makes it really easy to create documentation pages for developers calling your services.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_01225169.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3C098432.png\" width=\"476\" height=\"338\" /></a></p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET SignalR</u></h2>  <p>ASP.NET SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to your applications. Real-time web functionality is the ability to have server-side code push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available.</p>  <p>You may have heard of the HTML5 WebSocket API that enables efficient bidirectional communication between the browser and server. SignalR uses Websockets when it is supported by the browser and the server, and gracefully falls back to other techniques and technologies when it is not (best of all your application code can stay the same regardless of which is being used).</p>  <p>SignalR provides a simple API for creating server-to-client remote procedure calls (RPC) that call JavaScript functions in client browsers from server-side .NET code. SignalR also includes API for connection management (for instance, connect and disconnect events), grouping connections, and authorization.</p>  <p>Included in today’s release is Visual Studio 2012 template support for creating SignalR projects as well as adding SignalR support to existing Web Forms and MVC applications:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_76F0B6FB.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6D978278.png\" width=\"628\" height=\"354\" /></a></p>  <p>Read more about SignalR at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/signalr\">http://www.asp.net/signalr</a>.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET Web Forms Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>ASP.NET Friendly URLs enable you to remove the .aspx extension from your Web Forms pages, making your sites’ URLs look cleaner. You can also pass parameters to pages as segments of the URL. For example, instead of ProductDetails.aspx?id=5 you can have ProductsDetails/5. With Friendly URLs you can also easily support mobile devices by creating mobile versions of pages:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>YourPage.aspx</strong> – This is the page that will be rendered by default on a browser.</li>    <li><strong>YourPage.Mobile.aspx</strong> – This is the version of the page that will be rendered by default on a mobile browser.</li>    <li><strong>YourPage.<i>Device</i>.aspx</strong> – You can write your own code to map a user-agent string to a specific device name. For example, you could have pages for Windows Phone, iPhone, and Android devices.</li> </ul>  <h2><u>ASP.NET MVC Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>A new Facebook Application template makes writing Facebook Canvas applications using ASP.NET MVC really easy. In a few simple steps, you can create a Facebook application that gets data from a logged in user and integrates with their friends. The template includes a new library to take care of all the plumbing involved in building a Facebook app, including authentication, permissions, accessing Facebook data and more. This lets you focus on building the business logic in your app. The Facebook apps you can build with this new template are hosted on the web and displayed inside the Facebook chrome via an iframe. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_721093F0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2162097B.png\" width=\"363\" height=\"485\" /></a></p>  <p><strong><u>Single Page Applications</u></strong></p>      <p>A new Single Page Application template for ASP.NET MVC is also now included and allows developers to build interactive client-side web apps using HTML 5, CSS 3, and the popular Knockout and jQuery JavaScript libraries – all on on top of ASP.NET Web API. </p>  <p>The default template creates a “todo” list application that demonstrates common practices for building a JavaScript HTML5 application that uses a RESTful server API. You can read more at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/single-page-application\">http://www.asp.net/single-page-application</a>.</p>  <p>If you don’t want to use the new Knockout template there are 4 new community-created templates. These templates were built using the improved <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/fall-2012-update/custom-mvc-templates\">Custom MVC Template</a> support:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282649\" target=\"_blank\">BreezeJS</a> template that uses BreezeJS and Knockout for data binding and templating</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282647\" target=\"_blank\">Ember</a> template uses the latest version of Ember and Handlebars</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282648\" target=\"_blank\">DurandalJS</a> template is built using the new MVVM library DurandalJS as well as Knockout</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282646\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Towel</a> uses BreezeJS, DurandalJS, Knockout, require.js and Bootstrap</li> </ul>  <p>You’ll see even more templates in the months ahead.</p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Authentication Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>A new pre-release of Windows Azure Authentication is also now available for MVC, Web Pages, and Web Forms. This feature enables your application to authenticate Office 365 users from your organization, corporate accounts synced from your on-premise Active Directory, or users created in your own custom Windows Azure Active Directory domain. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/fall-2012-update/windows-azure-authentication\">Windows Azure Authentication tutorial</a>.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>Today’s ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update has a lot of useful features for all developers using ASP.NET.&#160; Read the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=279941\" target=\"_blank\">release notes</a> to learn even more, and <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282650\" target=\"_blank\">install it</a> today!</p>  <p><strong><font color=\"#ff0000\">Important Installation Note</font></strong>: If you have installed an earlier version of Mads Kristensen’s excellent (and free) <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6\" target=\"_blank\">Web Essentials 2012 extension</a>, you’ll want to update it to the latest version before installing today’s ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update.&#160; The latest version of the <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6\" target=\"_blank\">Web Essentials 2012 extension</a> works well with today’s release – if you have an older version you will get a runtime error when you launch Visual Studio.&#160; Updating to the latest version of the extension prior to installing the ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update will fix this.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

[["author", "ScottGu"], ["content", "<p>During the BUILD 2012 conference we announced a new capability of Windows Azure: the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/overview/\">Windows Azure Store</a>. The Windows Azure Store makes it incredibly easy for you to discover, purchase, and provision premium add-on services, provided by our partners, for your cloud based applications. For example, you can use the Windows Azure Store to easily setup a MongoDB database in seconds, or quickly setup an analytics service like NewRelic that gives you deep insight into your application’s performance.</p>  <p>There is a growing list of app and data services now available through the Windows Azure Store, and the list is constantly expanding.&#160; Many services offered through the store include a free tier, which makes it incredibly easy for you to try them out with no obligation required.&#160; Services you decide to ultimately buy are automatically added to your standard Windows Azure bill – enabling you to add new capabilities to your applications without having to enter a credit card again nor setup a separate payment mechanism.&#160; </p>  <p>The Windows Azure Store is currently available to customers in 11 markets: US, UK, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Spain, and South Korea.&#160; Over the next few weeks we’ll be expanding the store to be available in even more countries and territories around the world.</p>  <h2><u>Signing up for an Add-On from the Windows Azure Store</u></h2>  <p>It is incredibly easy to start using a partner add-on from the Windows Azure store:</p>  <p>1) Sign-into the Windows Azure Management Portal</p>  <p>2) Click the New button (in the bottom-left corner) and then select the “Store” item within it:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_4EF1B32C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_42EFC2F8.png\" width=\"903\" height=\"470\" /></a></p>  <p>3) This will bring up UI that allows you to browse all of the partner add-ons available within the Store:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7DD6F5C1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_54CEE776.png\" width=\"828\" height=\"544\" /></a></p>  <p>You will see two categories of add-ons available: app services and data. Explore each to get an idea of the types of services available, and don’t forget to check back often, as the list is growing quickly!</p>  <p>4) Let’s try out a free app service from SendGrid, which lets you send e-mail from your application using a REST API or an SMTP server. Choose SendGrid from the list and click the next arrow.&#160; This will display more information about SendGrid, as well as a variety of plan options.&#160; Note that they offer a Free plan that allows you to send 6,000 emails/month, and then paid plans with more features and scale:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_68E803FF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2AEE7341.png\" width=\"812\" height=\"532\" /></a></p>  <p>5) Let’s select the free plan and click the next arrow.&#160; Doing so will display the final screen – which shows us how much this purchase will cost.&#160; In this case it will cost nothing.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1AE2353B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_15FF817F.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"537\" /></a></p>  <p>6) Click the “Purchase” button to complete the transaction (and if it was a non-free plan add it to your Windows Azure bill automatically).&#160; Once you click Purchase, SendGrid will provision an account for you and then you are ready to use it.&#160; No additional sign-up/billing steps required.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Using an Add-On from the Windows Azure Store</u></h2>  <p>The Windows Azure Management portal makes it really easy to track and manage the add-on services you sign-up for.&#160; Once the above steps are completed, the SendGrid service will show up in the list of “add ons” for your account.&#160; Click the “add-ons” tab within the portal to display and manage these:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_3F0A207B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_01108FBD.png\" width=\"875\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>  <p>Clicking on the SendGrid item will display information about the service – including details on how many emails I’ve used from my 200/day quota for the free tier:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5C12CF43.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_65026182.png\" width=\"876\" height=\"488\" /></a></p>  <p>A row of buttons at the bottom of the page lets you interact with the add-on:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>Manage</b> opens a new browser tab and signs you into the provider’s own admin portal without requiring you to enter a username or password (we automatically use single-sign-on with your azure account). For example, SendGrid’s admin portal lets you view statistics about email delivery and bounce rates. </li>    <li><b>Connection Info</b> provides you with the security credentials necessary to programmatically connect to the add-on’s service. For example, SendGrid provides an SMTP server, username and password which can be used directly within your application to send e-mail. </li>    <li><b>Upgrade </b>lets<b> </b>you upgrade your plan from free to a higher paid tier. </li>    <li><b>Contact settings</b> let you manage whether the provider can contact you with promotional materials.

Notification Hubs provide a common API to send push notifications to multiple device platforms.&#160; Your app can send notifications in platform specific formats or in a platform-independent way.&#160; As of January 2013, Notification Hubs are able to push notifications to Windows 8 apps and iOS apps.&#160; Support for Android and Windows Phone will be added soon. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li>     <p><strong>Efficient Pub/Sub Routing and Tag-based Multicast</strong>. Notification Hubs are optimized to enable push notification broadcast to thousands or millions of devices with low latency.&#160; Your server back-end can fire one message into a Notification Hub, and thousands/millions of push notifications can automatically be delivered to your users.&#160; Devices and apps can specify a number of <em>per-user</em> <em>tags</em> when registering with a Notification Hub. These tags do not need to be pre-provisioned or disposed, and provide a very easy way to send filtered notifications to an infinite number of users/devices with a single API call.&#160; Since tags can contain any app-specific string (e.g. user ids, favorite sports teams, stock symbols to track, location details, etc), their use effectively frees the app back-end from the burden of having to store and manage device handles or implement their own per-user notification routing information.&#160; </p>   </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li>     <p><b>Extreme Scale</b>. Notification Hubs enable you to reach millions of devices without you having to re-architect or shard your application.&#160; The pub/sub routing mechanism allows you to broadcast notifications in a super efficient way.&#160; This makes it incredibly easy to route and deliver notification messages to millions of users without having to build your own routing infrastructure.</p>   </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Usable from any Backend App</b>. Notification Hubs can be easily integrated into any back-end server app.&#160; It will work seamlessly with apps built with Windows Azure Mobile Services.&#160; It can also be used by server apps hosted within IaaS Virtual Machines (either Windows or Linux), Cloud Services or Web-Sites.&#160; This makes it easy for you to take advantage of it immediately without having to change the rest of your backend app architecture.</li> </ul>  <h2><u>Try Notification Hubs Today</u></h2>  <p> You can try the new Notification Hub support in Windows Azure by creating a new Notification Hub within the Windows Azure Management Portal – you can create one by selecting the <em>Service Bus Notification Hub</em> item under the “App Services” category in the <strong>New</strong> dialog:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1AB39405.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4352000C.png\" width=\"891\" height=\"644\" /></a></p>  <p>Creating a new Notification Hub takes less than a minute, and once created you can drill into it to see a dashboard view of activity with it.&#160; Among other things it allows you to see how many devices have been registered with it, how many messages have been pushed to it, how many messages have been successfully delivered via it, and how many have failed:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_39F8CB89.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2DF6DB55.png\" width=\"879\" height=\"575\" /></a></p>  <p>You can then click the “Configure” tab to register your Notification Hub with Microsoft’s Windows Notification System and Apple’s APNS service (we’ll add Android support in a future update):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_64D3C04C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_26DA2F8E.png\" width=\"879\" height=\"575\" /></a></p>  <p>Once this is setup, its simple to register any client app/device with a Notification Hub (optionally associating “tags” with them so that you can have the Notification Hub automatically filter for you who gets which messages).&#160; You can then broadcast messages to your users/mobile apps with only a few lines of code.</p>  <p>For example, below is some code that you could implement within your server back-end app to broadcast a message to all Windows 8 users registered with your Notification Hub:</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 8pt 0.5in;

The Notification Hub will automatically handle the pub/sub scale-out infrastructure necessary to scale your message to any number of registered device listeners in a low-latency way without you having to worry about implementing any of that scale-out logic yourself (nor block on this happening within your own code).&#160;

This release is now live in production, supported by a <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">new media services dev center</a>, backed by an enterprise SLA, and is ready to be used for all media projects.</p>  <p>With today’s release, you now have everything you need to quickly build great, extremely scalable, end-to-end media solutions for streaming on-demand video to consumers on any device.&#160; For example, you can easily build a media service for delivering training videos to employees in your company, stream video content for your web-site, or build a premium video-on-demand service like Hulu or Netflix.&#160; Last year several broadcasters used Windows Azure Media Services to <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/08/21/windows-azure-media-services-and-the-london-2012-olympics.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">stream the London 2012 Olympics</a>.</p>  <h2><u>Media Platform as a Service </u></h2>  <p>With Windows Azure Media Services, you can stream video to HTML5, Flash, Silverlight, Windows 8, iPad, iPhone, Android, Xbox, Windows Phone and other clients using a wide variety of streaming formats:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_30781B63.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2E3E2358.png\" width=\"845\" height=\"236\" /></a></p>  <p>Building a media solution that encodes and streams video to various devices and clients is a complex task.&#160; It requires hardware and software that has to be connected, configured, and maintained.&#160; Windows Azure Media Services makes this problem much easier by eliminating the need to provision and manage your own custom infrastructure.&#160; Windows Azure Media Services accomplishes this by providing you with a Media Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enables you to easily scale your business as it grows, and pay only for what you use. </p>  <p>As a developer, you can control Windows Azure Media Services by using <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">REST APIs or .NET and Java SDKs</a> to build a media workflow that can automatically upload, encode and deliver video.&#160; We’ve also developed a broad set of client SDKs and player frameworks which let you build completely custom video clients that integrate in your applications.&#160; This allows you to configure and control every aspect of the video playback experience, including inserting pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll, and overlay advertisement into your content.</p>  <h2><u>Upload, Encode, Deliver, Consume</u></h2>  <p>A typical video workflow involves uploading raw video to storage, encoding &amp; protecting the content, and then streaming that content to users who can consume it on any number of devices.&#160; For each of these major steps, we’ve built a number of features that you’ll find useful:</p>  <p><b><u>Upload</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services supports multiple different options to upload assets into Media Services:</p>  <ol>   <li>Using REST APIs, or .NET or Java SDKs you can upload files to the server over HTTP/S with AES 256 encryption.&#160; This works well for smaller sets of files and is for great uploading content on a day to day basis. </li>    <li><a href=\"http://blog-ndrouin.azurewebsites.net/?p=561\">Bulk upload</a> an entire media library with thousands of large files.&#160; Uploading large asset files can be a bottleneck for asset creation and by using a bulk ingesting approach, you can save a lot of time.&#160; For bulk upload, you can use the Bulk Ingest .NET Library or a partner upload solution such as <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/service/?name=aspera\" target=\"_blank\">Aspera</a> which uses UDP for transporting files at very rapid speeds.&#160; </li>    <li>If you already have content in Windows Azure blob storage, we also support blob to blob transfers and storage account to storage account transfers.&#160; </li>    <li>We also enable to you to upload content through the Windows Azure Portal – which is useful for small jobs or when first getting started.</li> </ol>  <p><b><u>Encode and then Deliver</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services provides built-in support for encoding media into a variety of different file-formats.&#160; With Windows Azure Media Services, you don’t need to buy or configure custom media encoding software or infrastructure – instead you can simply send REST calls (or use the .NET or Java SDK) to automate kicking off encoding jobs that Windows Azure Media Services will process and scale for you.</p>  <p>Last month, I <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/12/21/great-updates-to-windows-azure-mobile-services-web-sites-sql-data-sync-acs-media-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> we added <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/12/21/great-updates-to-windows-azure-mobile-services-web-sites-sql-data-sync-acs-media-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reserved capacity encoding support to Media Service</a> which gives you the ability to scale up the number of encoding tasks you can process in parallel. Using the SCALE page within the Windows Azure Portal, you can add reserved encoding units that let you encode multiple tasks concurrently (giving you faster encode jobs and predictable performance).&#160; </p>  <p>Today, we have also added new reserved capacity support for on-demand streaming (giving you more origin server capacity) - which can also now be provisioned on the same SCALE page in the management portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_502985DC.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3FB114E1.png\" width=\"755\" height=\"499\" /></a></p>  <p>In addition to giving your video service more origin streaming capacity to handle a greater number of concurrent users consuming different video content, our on-demand streaming support also now gives you a cool new feature we call <em>dynamic packaging</em>.</p>  <p>Traditionally, once content has been encoded, it needs to be packaged and stored for multiple targeted clients (iOS, XBox, PC, etc.).&#160; This traditional packaging process converts multi-bitrate MP4 files into multi-bitrate HLS file-sets or multi-bitrate Smooth Streaming files.&#160; This triples the storage requirements and adds significant processing cost and delay.</p>  <p>With dynamic packaging, we now allow users to store a single file format and stream to many adaptive protocol formats automatically.&#160; The packaging and conversion happens in real-time on the origin server which results in significant storage cost and time savings:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1CEFDD24.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3A64BEE1.png\" width=\"833\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>  <p>Today the source formats can be multi-bitrate MP4 or Smooth based, and these can be converted dynamically to either HLS or Smooth.&#160; The pluggable nature of this architecture will allow us, over the next few months, to also add DASH Live Profile streaming of fragmented MP-4 segments using time-based indexing as well.&#160; The support of HLS and the addition of DASH enables an ecosystem-friendly model based on common and standards-based streaming protocols, and ensures that you can target any type of device. </p>  <p><b><u>Consume</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services provides a large set of client player SDKs for all major devices and platforms, and they let you not only reach any device with a format that’s best suited for that device - but also build a custom player experience that uniquely integrates into your product or service.</p>  <p>Your users can consume media assets by building rich media applications rapidly on many platforms, such as Windows, iOS, XBox, etc.&#160; At this time, we ship <a href=\"http://mingfeiy.com/client-ecosystem-for-windows-azure-media-services/\">SDKs and player frameworks</a> for:</p>  <ul>   <li>Windows 8 </li>    <li>iOS </li>    <li>Xbox</li>    <li>Flash Player (built using Adobe OSMF) </li>    <li>Silverlight</li>    <li>Windows Phone</li>    <li>Android </li>    <li>Embedded devices (Connected TV, IPTV)</li> </ul>  <p>To get started with developing players, visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Developer tools for Windows Azure Media Services</a>. The SDKs and player frameworks contain player samples that you can use as-is or customize with very little effort. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_42E81E2B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4931856A.png\" width=\"613\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>  <h2><b><u>Start Today</u></b></h2>  <p>I’m really excited about today’s the general availability (GA) release of Windows Azure Media Services.&#160; This release is now live in production, backed by an enterprise SLA, and is ready to be used for all projects.&#160; It makes building great media solutions really easy and very cost effective.</p>  <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/media/\">Windows Azure Media Services page</a> to learn more about the capabilities, and visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Media Service Dev Center</a> for tutorials, how-to articles, blogs, and more information and get started building applications with it today!</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

[["author", "ScottGu"], ["content", "<p>This morning we released a number of enhancements to Windows Azure.&#160; These new capabilities include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Mobile Services (job scheduler support, Europe Region Support, Command Line Support) </li>    <li>Web Sites (scale improvements, integrated source control) </li>    <li>SQL Data Sync (support in the new HTML portal) </li>    <li>ACS Management (support in the new HTML portal) </li>    <li>Media Services (job and task management, blob storage support, reserved compute) </li>    <li>Virtual Network enhancements </li>    <li>Subscription Filtering Support </li>    <li>Windows Azure Store (now available in more countries) </li> </ul>  <p>All of these improvements are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; Below are more details on them:</p>  <h2><u>Mobile Services </u></h2>  <p>Windows Azure Mobile Services now supports the ability to easily schedule background jobs (aka CRON jobs) that execute on a pre-set timer interval, and which can run independently of a device accessing the service (ensuring that you don’t block or slow-down any requests from your users).&#160; This job scheduler functionality allows you to perform a variety of useful scenarios without having to create or manage a separate VM.&#160; Some of the scenarios you can enable with it include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Periodically purging old/duplicate data from your tables. </li>    <li>Periodically querying and aggregating data from external web service (tweets, RSS entries, location information) and cache it in your tables for subsequent use. </li>    <li>Periodically processing/resizing images submitted by users of your service. </li>    <li>Scheduling the sending of push notifications or SMS messages to your customers to ensure they arrive at the right time of the day. </li> </ul>  <p>Using today’s release you can now easily register background tasks by navigating to the new <b>Scheduler</b> tab of your mobile service in the Windows Azure portal, and then by clicking the <strong>Create</strong> button:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_0AFBFE83.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5EDF0191.png\" width=\"836\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>  <p>Doing this enables you to name a new job, and select how often you want to run it (note: you can also change the schedule later on):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2EB7B6CE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_09B9F655.png\" width=\"836\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>  <p>Once a job is created, you can drill into it and select the <b>Script </b>tab to author the server script you want to be executed on a recurring interval.&#160; As an example, the below script fetches Twitter updates about “red polos” and sends out a push notification from the mobile service: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5992AB91.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_64BEC68C.png\" width=\"865\" height=\"560\" /></a></p>  <p>Once you’ve entered the script, you can save and then click the <b>Run Once</b> button to execute a trial run. The <b>Run Once</b> functionality lets you easily test your job script before you enable the job for recurring execution.&#160; To enable recurring execution of the job, click either the <strong>Enable </strong>button within the script-view or go back to the <b>Scheduler</b> tab, select the job, and click the <strong>Enable </strong>button to activate it.</p>  <p>This new job scheduler capability makes it incredibly easy to integrate background work within your Mobile Service (without having to create or manage a separate VM to run it in).&#160; It can be used by all Mobile Service (even the free-tier level).&#160; The free-tier of Mobile Services includes support that allows you to run one background job every hour.&#160; If you upgrade your mobile service to have a reserved instance you can run up to 10 jobs every 15 minutes.</p>  <p>Check-out the Windows Azure Mobile Services documentation for an even more in-depth <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/schedule-backend-tasks/\">job scheduler tutorial</a>.</p>  <p><u>Mobile Service Region Support in Europe</u></p>  <p>Before today, our preview of Windows Azure Mobile Services was only supported in the US East and US West regions of Windows Azure.&#160; With this week’s update you can now also create Mobile Services in the North Europe region as well. As with every Windows Azure service, over time we will extend Mobile Services to all Windows Azure regions world-wide:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_53DA229C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0F2D885B.png\" width=\"559\" height=\"371\" /></a></p>  <p><u>Mobile Service Command Line Support</u></p>  <p>Earlier this year we released a cross-platform Windows Azure Command Line Tool (a.k.a ‘azure’) that allows you to manage Windows Azure Web Sites, VMs and other services from the command line on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can learn more about it <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/command-line-tools/\">here</a>.&#160; Today we have released an update for this tool that adds support for Windows Azure Mobile Services as well.&#160; To get started, install the ‘azure’ tool for <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=275464&amp;clcid=0x409\">Windows</a> or <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=253471&amp;clcid=0x409\">Mac</a>. </p>  <p>If you haven’t used the tool before, you need to perform a one-time step and download/import the Windows Azure management credentials for your account. In a command prompt run the following command to download Windows Azure publish settings:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure account download</font></p>  <p>then import the .publishsettings file you just downloaded:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure account import &quot;C:\\temp\\my-credentials.publishsettings&quot;</font></p>  <p>Once you do this you’ll be able to access your Windows Azure subscription and perform operations against it entirely from the command-line.&#160; For example, using today’s update we can now create a new Window Azure Mobile Service entirely from the command-line (no portal interaction required at all):</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile create scottgucli</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_786E40D1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_05D453D8.png\" width=\"681\" height=\"263\" /></a></p>  <p>And with that simple command we now have a newly created Windows Azure Mobile Service!</p>  <p>Creating new tables with the mobile service can likewise now be done entirely from the command-line:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile table create scottgucli products</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6C6C509D.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_19ED7061.png\" width=\"681\" height=\"167\" /></a></p>  <p>Many users have asked for the ability to directly upload scripts from their file system (without having to go through the portal) and the new CLI support makes this really easy. For example, to upload an “insert” script for the products table we just created above you can use the following command:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile script upload scottgucli table/products.insert -f c:\\code\\products.js</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_20A079E4.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_27538367.png\" width=\"841\" height=\"191\" /></a></p>  <p>Now this script will run every time a record is inserted into the products table.</p>  <h2><u>Web Sites</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release we have increased the scaling capabilities of our Windows Azure Web Sites service.&#160; </p>  <p>Previously a web-site could only be scaled up to run across 3 shared instances or 3 reserved VMs.&#160; With today’s release we now support the ability for you to scale up a web-site to run across 6 shared instances (beyond which it is cheaper to switch to a reserved instance):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5BF3DFA2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6B967B64.png\" width=\"826\" height=\"493\" /></a></p>  <p>With today’s release we also now support the ability for you to scale up a web-site to run across 10 reserved VM instances (where you are guaranteed to be the only customer using those VMs).&#160; You can use either Small, Medium, or Large sized VMs when doing this:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_090B5D22.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;

Choose the <strong>NEW-&gt;Website-&gt;Custom Create</strong> command to try this out:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2F039E29.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;

SQL Data Sync lets you synchronize data between multiple SQL databases.&#160; These SQL databases can span across your on-premises environment and the cloud, or across multiple cloud hosted databases (for example: within multiple Windows Azure regions around the world).&#160; It is a very powerful capability that can enable a variety of interesting scenarios.</p>  <p>To use SQL Data Sync, go to the SQL Databases section of the new Windows Azure Management Portal and click on the new <strong>ADD SYNC </strong>command in the bottom tray of it:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40768FB2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;

Give it a name.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_693C37BF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7DC1873D.png\" width=\"610\" height=\"418\" /></a></p>  <p>2. Choose the hub database, and provide connection credentials.&#160; The hub database is the central database within the group and must be a SQL Database in Windows Azure: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40342974.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_349E6C35.png\" width=\"607\" height=\"415\" /></a></p>  <p>3. Then add a reference database, and provide connection credentials.&#160; Think of reference databases as “spoke” or “member” databases that connect with the hub database.&#160; They can be any combination of on-premise SQL Servers or other Windows Azure SQL Databases.&#160; They can sync bi-directionally with the hub, to the hub, or from the hub:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_14172C83.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_561D9BC4.png\" width=\"692\" height=\"481\" /></a></p>  <p>Once you’ve completed the above steps, your sync group is setup. </p>  <p><b><u>DEFINING SYNC RULES</u></b></p>  <p>You can now drill into the sync group to define your sync rules, manage the reference databases, add new reference databases, configure sync settings, and view historical sync logs.&#160; Note that you must define your sync rules via the <b>SYNC RULES </b>tab before syncing will begin.&#160; These rules determine the tables, columns, and even the rows that will be involved in the sync. You will want to choose the rules based on the needs of the application. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7F283AC0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1A6093C2.png\" width=\"654\" height=\"356\" /></a></p>  <p><b><u>CONFIGURING SYNC</u></b></p>  <p>Once the sync rules have been defined, the sync group can be synchronized, either on demand using the <b>SYNC</b> button or on regular scheduled interval.&#160; Use the <b>CONFIGURE</b> tab to setup a sync schedule to have the synchronization happen automatically.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_07AB9A0B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_22E3F30C.png\" width=\"654\" height=\"506\" /></a></p>  <p>Once setup, your databases will automatically synchronize.&#160; This can work either between your on-premises environment and the cloud, or between multiple cloud databases (for example: within multiple Windows Azure regions around the world).&#160; It is a very powerful capability that can enable a variety of compelling scenarios.</p>  <h2><u>Active Directory Access Control Management (ACS) Support</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, you can also now create and manage Windows Azure Active Directory Access Control namespaces from the new Windows Azure Management Portal. </p>  <p>Windows Azure AD Access Control is a service that lets you authenticate and authorize users for your web applications and services, while allowing authentication and authorization features to be factored out of your code. ACS works with standards-based identity providers, including enterprise directories such as Active Directory, and web identities such as Windows Live ID, Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook. For more information, see Windows Azure AD <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=272724\">Access Control</a>.</p>  <p><u>Creating an ACS Namespace</u></p>  <p>To create an Access Control namespace, click <b>NEW </b>in the Windows Azure Management Portal, and select <b>APP SERVICES</b> <b>-&gt; ACCESS CONTROL -&gt;QUICK CREATE</b>.&#160; In the namespace field, type the name of the Access Control namespace that you want to create:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40C507BE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5BFD60BF.png\" width=\"873\" height=\"289\" /></a></p>  <p><u>Managing a Namespace</u></p>  <p>To manage an Access Control namespace, click on the new <strong>Active Directory </strong>node in the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_49486708.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1201DFCD.png\" width=\"845\" height=\"470\" /></a></p>  <p>Then, select the namespace you want to manage, and click the <b>MANAGE</b> button in the command bar at the bottom of the screen.&#160; This will open the ACS Management Portal.&#160; You can additionally move your ACS namespaces from one subscription to another via the <b>CHANGE SUBSCRIPTION</b> command in the bottom of the page. </p>  <p>For more information about other recent enhancements that make Windows Azure AD more useful for developers, read Alex Simons’ blog post <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/07/enhancements-to-windows-azure-active-directory-preview.aspx\">here</a>, and Bill Hilf’s post <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/27/windows-azure-active-directory-processes-200-billion-authentications-connecting-people-data-and-devices-around-the-globe.aspx\">here</a>.&#160; Even more Active Directory functionality will be integrated within the Windows Azure Portal next year.</p>  <h2><u>Media Service Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>Today’s release contains a number of great enhancements to Windows Azure Media Services.&#160; This release includes investments to:</p>  <ul>   <li>Job and Task management </li>    <li>Adding content from a Windows Azure storage account </li>    <li>Scaling your media services account to increase encoding concurrency </li> </ul>  <p><u>Job and Task Management</u></p>  <p>You can now track the progress and history of your media encoding jobs from within the Windows Azure Portal.&#160; The new <b>JOBS</b> tab within the Media Services extension lets you define custom queries for jobs by status, timeframe, or Job Id:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_21A47B8F.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_25B15A12.png\" width=\"838\" height=\"658\" /></a></p>  <p>The results of your queries will appear below the query editor.&#160; You can expand jobs to see information about the tasks that make up the job giving you deeper insight into each individual job and determine where things are progressing as planned or might require attention. You can also select a job within the list to either cancel the job or view details including errors related to the tasks.</p>  <p><b><u>Adding Content from Windows Azure Storage</u></b></p>  <p>Prior to this release, the only way to get content into your media services account was to write code using the Azure Media SDK, or upload a file within the portal from your local computer.&#160; Today we are introducing a new feature within the Windows Azure Portal that lets you choose existing media files from Windows Azure Blob Storage, thereby reducing your upload latency.&#160; From the <b>CONTENT </b>tab within the Media Services extension, you can select the <b>UPLOAD </b>command.&#160; </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_70A75B92.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_792ABADC.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>  <p>Notice the file browser now offers a <b>FROM STORAGE </b>option in addition to the previous “FROM LOCAL” support we already shipped.&#160; Note that the 200 MB limit mentioned in the header only applies to the <b>FROM LOCAL</b> option.&#160; Files sizes in the tens of gigabytes are supported via the <b>FROM STORAGE </b>option:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2F9B6CDF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_643BC91A.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"448\" /></a></p>  <p>The <b>FROM STORAGE</b> option will open the storage browser; you will be able to select a media file from blob storage from here.&#160; </p>  <p><b><u>Reserved Capacity for Media Service Jobs</u></b></p>  <p>With today’s release we have also added a new capability that allows you to scale up the number of encoding tasks you are processing.&#160; By default, we only support having one active encoding task at a time.&#160; Using the new <b>SCALE</b> page, you can reserve encoding units that let you encode multiple tasks concurrently and have even more processing power reserved for your media workflows:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_31D7F59B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_73DE64DC.png\" width=\"803\" height=\"369\" /></a></p>  <h2><u>Virtual Networking Simplifications</u></h2>  <p>Based on customer feedback, we have significantly simplified the virtual network creation workflow within the Windows Azure Portal.&#160; In an earlier release, we had introduced a “Quick Create” workflow that simplified the most common virtual networking scenarios. In this release, we have further simplified the “Custom Create” experience to make creating more advanced scenarios easier as well.

Some users have one subscription for each department in their company; others have one for each environment (development, testing, and production).&#160; Some users even have one for each external customer that they work with.&#160; Regardless of which category you fall into, you might find that managing all of the resources across all subscriptions can be challenging, difficult to navigate, and can result in a sluggish experience.</p>  <p>Starting today a new <strong>subscription</strong> filter UI now appears next to your user name in the top right-hand side of the Windows Azure portal to help filter your views by one or more subscriptions.&#160; Selecting it will display a drop-down list that enables you to quickly filter which subscriptions you want to see in the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_0A5B4628.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1C3A6AA6.png\" width=\"812\" height=\"514\" /></a></p>  <p>By default, all of your subscriptions are selected and loaded into the portal.&#160; Using the dropdown, you can now pick and choose exactly which subscriptions you want to manage.&#160; This will provide a few noticeable benefits: </p>  <ul>   <li>Resources associated with hidden subscriptions are <b>filtered out</b> of all the experiences across the portal. </li>    <li>Your filter selection <b>roams with you across sessions and devices</b>.&#160; If you set a filter on your laptop it will take affect when you return to your desktop or mobile device. </li>    <li>Users with many subscriptions will notice a <b>significant performance improvement</b> when loading only a small subset of their subscriptions since data for subscriptions that are filtered out is never loaded. </li> </ul>  <p>Note: If you only have one subscription, this change doesn’t affect you one bit.&#160; Your experience remains unchanged.&#160; In fact, you’ll only see the subscription filter UI show-up if you have more than subscription.</p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Store Now Available in More Countries</u></h2>  <p>This week we have also expanded the number of countries that the Windows Azure Store is available within (previously it was only available in the United States).&#160; The Windows Azure Store enables you to easily subscribe to services provided by 3rd party partners of ours – and have them automatically added to your Windows Azure bill.&#160; It is an incredibly cool capability – and one I’ll be blogging a lot more about shortly.</p>  <p>In the mean-time, try it out by selecting the <strong>New-&gt;Store</strong> command within the portal and sign-up for one of the services in it today.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; Below are more details on them:If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

These new capabilities include:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Mobile Services</strong>: HTML5/JS (CORS) Client + PhoneGap + Windows Phone 7.5 + .NET Portable Library support </li>    <li><strong>Web Sites</strong>: Mercurial Source Control + Dropbox Deployment support </li>    <li><strong>HDInsight</strong>: New service that enables you to easily deploy and manage Hadoop Clusters on Azure </li> </ul>  <p>All of these improvements are now available to start using immediately (note: some services are still in preview). Below are more details on them:</p>  <h2><u>Mobile Services: HTML5/JS Client (CORS), PhoneGap, Windows Phone 7.5</u></h2>  <p>Today we are adding support to enable pure HTML5/JS clients (and PhoneGap apps) as well as Windows Phone 7.5 clients to use Windows Azure Mobile Services as a backend.&#160; This comes in addition to the new <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/03/04/windows-azure-updates-android-support-sql-reporting-services-active-directory-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Android SDK for Windows Azure Mobile Services</a> we released two weeks ago (as well as the Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and iOS support we had earlier). </p>  <p><u><strong>HTML5/JS Clients</strong></u></p>  <p>You can now connect both HTML5 web client apps as well as Apache Cordova/PhoneGap apps to your Mobile Services, and use Windows Azure for both data storage and authentication.&#160; We are delivering this via:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>New Mobile Services web client library</b> that supports IE8+ browsers, current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, plus PhoneGap 2.3.0+. It offers the same data querying and storage APIs support we have in other native SDKs, and allows easy user authentication via any of the four identity providers supported by Mobile Services (Microsoft Account, Google, Facebook, and Twitter). Please use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services/issues\">GitHub issue tracker</a> to report any issues, and <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/\">our forum</a> to get help. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support</b> to enable your Mobile Service to accept cross-domain Ajax requests. You can now configure a whitelist of allowed domains for your Mobile Service using the Windows Azure management portal. </li> </ul>  <p>To get started, create a mobile service in the <a href=\"http://manage.windowsazure.com\">Windows Azure Management Portal</a> and open the Quickstart tab. You can now select “HTML” and find the steps to create a new HTML5/JS client or add a backend to an existing one: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_71F2F2B0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_338D2EFD.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"478\" /></a> </p>  <p>You can then continue with <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-html/\">this tutorial</a> for the remaining steps and build a simple HTML5 todo list app (that runs entirely in a browser) in under 5 minutes. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_38064075.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_13087FFC.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"293\" /></a> </p>  <p>When deploying the HTML5 front-end app to a production environment, make sure to add the host name of the website you use to host it to your Windows Azure Mobile Services’ Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) whitelist using the <strong>Configure</strong> tab as shown below:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6E0ABF82.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_04CC97BD.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"478\" /></a> </p>  <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/mobile\">Windows Azure Mobile dev center</a> and read <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-html/\">this tutorial</a> to learn more about working with server-side data, or <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-html/\">this one</a> if you want to learn more about authenticating users.</p>  <p><strong><u>Windows Phone 7.5 Support and a new C# Client Library on NuGet</u></strong></p>  <p>A few days ago we published a <a href=\"http://nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.MobileServices/0.3.0-alpha\">preview of our next version of the Mobile Services C# client library</a> on NuGet.&#160; The goal of this pre-release is to give Mobile Services developers an early look at the new features we are planning for our next C# SDK update and an opportunity to try them out ahead of time. Some of the great new features we have added include:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>Portable Library Support</b>: We have consolidated our Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 clients on top of a single codebase using Portable Libraries. This enables us to reach a variety of new client platforms, as well as enable you to call Mobile Services from your ASP.NET and .NET server backend. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Windows Phone 7.5 support:</b> With the move to Portable Libraries, we are also enabling support for Windows Phone 7.5</li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Json.NET and HttpClient: </b>We migrated our implementation to use the latest and most flexible HTTP components to enable maximum robustness and extensibility. </li> </ul>  <p>Note: Today’s drop is a pre-release. For production apps we recommend continuing to use the “stable” Mobile Service client libraries for .NET available for download <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/developer-tools/\">here</a>.&#160; </p>  <p><strong><u>Keep Giving Us Feedback</u></strong></p>  <p>Please continue to visit our <a href=\"https://mobileservices.uservoice.com/forums/182281-feature-requests/filters/top\" target=\"_blank\">uservoice</a> page to let us know what you’d like to see added next (today’s release added 3 of the top 5 asks in uservoice!). <a href=\"mailto:mobileservices@microsoft.com?subject=Windows%20Azure%20Mobile%20Services%20adds%20Android%20support,%20will%20deliver%20additional%20SDKs%20and%20extends%20availability%20to%20East%20Asia%20\">Email us</a> to show off your app, and ask questions in our <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/threads\">forum</a> whenever you run into a problem.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Web Sites: Mercurial and Dropbox Deployment Support</u></h2>  <p>Today’s release also includes a number of deployment/publishing enhancements to Windows Azure Web Sites:</p>  <p><strong><u>Mercurial Source Control Support</u></strong></p>  <p>You can now use Mercurial (Hg) repositories when setting up continuous deployment of your Websites from your CodePlex or Bitbucket repositories.&#160; This is in addition to the TFS, CodePlex, Git and GitHub source control provider support that we previously supported.&#160; </p>  <p>Today’s release also includes improved UI that makes it even easier to setup deployment from source-control.&#160; Simply click the “Setup deployment from source control” link on your web-site dashboard, and a new wizard will appear that makes it trivial to walkthrough setting up publishing endpoints using a variety of source control providers and sites.&#160; For example, below is how you could choose to enable source code deployment from a public or private Mercurial (Hg) repository you might have on Bitbucket:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_78CAA788.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0F8C7FC3.png\" width=\"688\" height=\"484\" /></a> </p>  <p><strong><u>Dropbox Deployment Support</u></strong></p>  <p>Windows Azure also now supports site/app deployment from Dropbox to Web sites, making website deployment as easy as copying files to a folder on your local computer.&#160; To enable this from the Windows Azure management portal, click the “Set up deployment from source control” link on your Web site dashboard, choose Dropbox and authorize the connection, and then choose a Dropbox sub-folder to synchronize: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_38971EBF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4186B0FE.png\" width=\"680\" height=\"476\" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>You can then simply copy your source files to the Dropbox sub-folder on your local computer and press the “Sync” button in the Windows Azure Portal to deploy the files.&#160; Windows Azure will automatically build sources as needed, similar to Git or TFS based deployments.&#160; Also, the deployment history tab in the portal will keep track of your deployments and enables you to re-deploy any previous deployment with the click of a button.</p>  <p>Watch this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC1xAjz6jHI&amp;hd=1\" target=\"_blank\">2 minute screencast</a> to see how easy it now is to deploy web sites to Windows Azure using Dropbox.</p>  <p><strong><u>Improved UI for Managing Source Control Deployments</u></strong></p>  <p>In addition to the new setup wizard for source control deployment, today’s Windows Azure release also includes some other nice enhancements to the source control UI.&#160; Deployment history in the management portal now accurately reflects which source control provider is connected for continuous deployment, such as TFS, CodePlex, GitHub, or Bitbucket.&#160; It is also now possible to disconnect from an already connected source provider on a web-site in order to set up a different one (previously you had to delete the site to do this).</p>  <p><strong><u>TFS Certificate Renewal</u></strong></p>  <p>It’s also now possible to renew the certificate used by Team Foundation Service for continuous deployment directly from the Windows Azure management portal. To do this, click the “Renew TFS certificate” link on either the Dashboard or Quick Start page.</p>  <p><strong><u>Support for Regenerating the Publish Profile</u></strong></p>  <p>Today you can download a publish profile from the Web Sites dashboard. Once that profile is downloaded, the credentials are basically good forever. We understand that this is not optimal. To address this, with today’s release we are introducing a new quick glance command in the dashboard called <b>Reset publish profile credentials</b>. When clicked, you will get a confirmation for resetting the credentials and the credentials are regenerated.</p>  <h2><u>New HDInsight Server: Deploy and Manage Hadoop Clusters on Azure</u></h2>  <p>Today we also <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286692\">released</a> a public preview of the new HDInsight Service for Windows Azure. HDInsight provides everything you need to quickly deploy, manage and use Hadoop clusters running on Windows Azure. </p>  <p>If you have a Windows Azure account you can <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286685\">request access</a> to the HDInsight Preview and then easily create an HDInsight cluster within the <a href=\"http://manage.windowsazure.com\">Windows Azure Management Portal</a>. Within the Windows Azure Management Portal click the New button and select the new HDInsight service to create a Hadoop cluster.&#160; Specify a name for the cluster, a password for logging into the cluster and the size of cluster you need:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_75BADA44.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_69B8EA10.png\" width=\"868\" height=\"580\" /></a> </p>  <p><em>Note: a storage account is required to create a cluster and in the current public preview the storage account must reside in the East US region. The Azure Storage account you associate with your cluster is where you will store the data that you will analyze in HDInsight.</em></p>  <p><strong><u>HDInsight Clusters</u></strong></p>  <p>A cluster will take a few minutes to create (as part of creating it will configure the necessary Virtual Machines that together make up your Hadoop cluster). The Hadoop components installed as part of an HDInsight cluster are outlined <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286746\">here</a>. Once the cluster is created, you can drill into the dashboard view to see the cluster quick glance screen. This quick glance allows you to see the basic information about your cluster and gives you a simple method to connect to the cluster (just click the <strong>Manage</strong> button at the bottom of the dashboard).</p>  <p>When you connect to the cluster you’ll see a page that contains a number of tiles that provide information about the cluster and can be used to perform additional tasks:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_75513800.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5B7D01D1.png\" width=\"649\" height=\"505\" /></a> </p>  <p>The <b>Create Job</b> tile opens a MapReduce job submission form that you can use to submit <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=287075\" target=\"_blank\">MapReduce</a> jobs as JAR files.

Below are more details on them:</p>  <h2><u>Mobile Services: Android, East Asia Region, iOS Content</u></h2>  <p>With the <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/08/28/announcing-windows-azure-mobile-services.aspx\">initial public preview</a> of Windows Azure Mobile Services, we promised that we would deliver first-class support for developers building Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, iOS and Android apps. We launched last year with Windows 8 support and shortly after added Windows Phone, and the iOS support.</p>  <p><u>Android Support</u></p>  <p>Today I’m happy to announce <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/android/\">Mobile Services support for the Android platform</a>. The Android Client SDK is <a href=\"https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services\">available on GitHub</a> under the Apache 2.0 license and we welcome community contributions.</p>  <p>To create a new Android app or connect an existing Android app to your Windows Azure Mobile Service, simply select the “Android” tab within the Quick Start view of a Mobile Service, and then follow either the “Create a new Android app” or “Connect to an existing Android app” link below it: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_19EA02AE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2B5CF437.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"570\" /></a> </p>  <p>Clicking either of these links will expand and display step-by-step instructions for how to build an Android application connected with your Windows Azure Mobile Service.</p>  <p>Read this <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-android\">getting started tutorial</a> to walkthrough how you can build (in less than 5 minutes) a simple Android “Todo List” app that stores data in Windows Azure. </p>  <p><u>Android Push Notifications</u></p>  <p>Windows Azure Mobile Services makes it easy to add push notification support to your apps without headaches. To send push notifications to your Android device, register for Google Cloud Messaging using <a href=\"https://code.google.com/apis/console\">https://code.google.com/apis/console</a> and obtain your API key, then simply paste that key on the Mobile Services ‘Push’ tab:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_0254E5EC.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7D72322F.png\" width=\"784\" height=\"570\" /></a> </p>  <p>After you’ve entered your API key, you can then send a notification from any server script under the ‘Data’ tab using the following code:</p>  <blockquote>   <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: consolas; mso-no-proof: yes\">push.gcm.send(registrationId, 'A new Mobile Services task', {       <br /><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>success: function(response) {        <br /><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>console.log('Push notification sent: ', response);        <br /><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>},         <br /><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>error: function(error) {        <br /><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>console.log('Error sending push notification: ', error);        <br /><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>}        <br />});</span><span style=\"mso-no-proof: yes\">       <p></p>     </span></p> </blockquote>  <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/mobile\">Windows Azure Mobile dev center</a> for the full Android tutorials that cover: </p>  <ul>   <li><a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-android/\">Getting started with data</a></li>    <li><a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-android/\">Authenticating users</a></li>    <li><a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-push-android/\">Sending push notifications</a></li> </ul>  <p>After you get up to speed with Android on Mobile Services, I encourage you to take a look at two additional Android samples for Mobile Services: <a href=\"https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/Android-MobileServices-TicTacToeLeaderboard\">TicTacToe Leaderboard</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/Android-MobileServices-Feedback\">Feedback</a>.</p>  <p><u>Mobile Services Availability in the East Asia Region</u></p>  <p>With this week’s release we also added the ability to deploy your Mobile Services to the East Asia region of Windows Azure in order to reduce latency for applications with customers in Asia.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_267CD12C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_13C7D775.png\" width=\"706\" height=\"470\" /></a> </p>  <p>As always, remember to deploy your Mobile Service and Windows Azure SQL database to the same data center in order to minimize latency.</p>  <p><u>Great iOS Developer Content</u></p>  <p>Earlier in November we released Windows Azure Mobile Services support for iOS. We recently invited Brent Simmons, the well-known iOS developer and creator of NetNewsWire to give Mobile Services a try. </p>  <p>If you haven’t tried Mobile Services yet, join Brent and follow his great <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/ios/\">video series on building iOS applications with Mobile Services</a>. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_361F6CEE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7ED8E5B2.png\" width=\"754\" height=\"570\" /></a> </p>  <p><u>Keep the Feedback Coming</u></p>  <p>This week’s Mobile Services updates are the direct result of your feedback.

To get started, create a SQL Reporting service by selecting <b>NEW -&gt; SQL REPORTING -&gt; QUICK CREATE</b>. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7989FF01.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7BC687BD.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"354\" /></a> </p>  <p>Once created, the <b>QUICK START</b> tab provides useful information for you to get started including links to tools and helpful articles on MSDN: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_16FEE0BF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_59055000.png\" width=\"796\" height=\"474\" /></a> </p>  <p>You can monitor the average and maximum number of reports processed in the dashboard view of your SQL reporting service.&#160; You can add users and manage permissions using the Users and Items tabs.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h2><u>Active Directory Integration</u></h2>  <p>We have made some great improvements with this week’s release in bringing enterprise level identity management to Windows Azure.&#160; Companies who sign up for Windows Azure as organizations (by creating a new Windows Azure Active Directory or signing up for Windows Azure with their Office 365 identity) will now find several new capabilities in the Windows Azure Management Portal:</p>  <ul>   <li>Ability to create and manage user accounts in your Windows Azure Active Directory. </li>    <li>Phone based two factor authentication for users who are Global Administrators in Windows Azure AD.</li>    <li>Ability to sync users from an on-premise Active Directory.&#160; </li>    <li>Ability to establish single sign with Azure (and other Microsoft Services like Office 365) using Active Directory Federation Services.</li> </ul>  <p>The Active Directory tab within the Windows Azure Management Portal now allows you to see all directories that your account is managing, as well as create and manage users, domains and directory integration settings:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_54229C44.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1D4847FE.png\" width=\"856\" height=\"429\" /></a> </p>  <p>For a more detailed discussion of the new Active Directory support, read Alex Simons’ post on the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2013/02/26/more-identity-and-access-management-improvements-in-windows-azure.aspx\">Azure Blog</a>.&#160; You’ll see this AD support get even better in the months ahead.</p>  <h2><u>Availability Monitoring for Cloud Services, Websites, Mobile Services, and VMs</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release we are enabling a new preview feature that will let you monitor the availability of your web applications. Web availability monitoring helps you understand the response time and availability of your web application from different locations around the world. This feature is available for Websites and Mobile Services in reserved mode, Cloud services in production environment, and for Virtual Machines.</p>  <p>You can try the web endpoint monitoring support in Windows Azure and enable your http/https endpoints to be tested from different locations. For example, to monitor your Web Site, scale the Web Site to reserved mode and then navigate to the configure page for the Web Site. Within the configure page, navigate to the monitoring section:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6A784189.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1AA21CFE.png\" width=\"878\" height=\"292\" /></a> </p>  <p>The monitoring section allows you to add multiple URLs that you wish to monitor.&#160; Add a friendly name for each URL and select the locations around the world that you wish to monitor it from. With this week’s preview you can monitor the Web URL from up to 3 test locations. After you have saved the configuration, the Web Site’s URL will be tested once every 5 minutes from each of the configured locations.</p>  <p>The results of the tests can be viewed on the Web Site’s dashboard as well as from the monitoring tab:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_07ED2347.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6A0E9F45.png\" width=\"801\" height=\"425\" /></a> </p>  <p>Availability is monitored using HTTP response codes, and response time. The Web Site is considered down when the response time is greater than 30 seconds or the HTTP status code is greater than 400.&#160; </p>  <p>The same features are available for Virtual Machines, Mobile Services and Cloud Services (in Production slot).</p>  <h2><u>Service Bus Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With this release, we have added some nice new capabilities to the Service Bus experience. First, the new <b>CONFIGURATION</b> tabs for Queues and Topics now enables you to edit runtime properties for these entities. We also allow you enable/disable Queues and Topics at the granularity of Send and Receive states:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7A1D6DFC.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1555C6FE.png\" width=\"860\" height=\"596\" /></a> </p>  <p>We have also added more dashboard metrics for Queues, Topics and Subscriptions. These include additions to operation counts and error counts.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_4989F044.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_36D4F68D.png\" width=\"819\" height=\"288\" /></a> </p>  <p>We have also significantly enhanced the content on the QUICK START page as well as provided the ability to download sample solutions that shows off how to build apps that use Service Bus Queues, Topics and Relays.</p>  <h2><u>Storage Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>You can now download blob storage files (even private blobs in your account) directly from within the Windows Azure Management Portal.&#160; From your storage account management page, go to the <b>CONTAINERS </b>tab to list your containers.&#160; Then click on the container name to go to the blob listing.&#160; You can select any blob and click the <b>DOWNLOAD BLOB </b>command on the command bar to download it directly from the browser:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_520D4F8E.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6D45A88F.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"426\" /></a> </p>  <p>Clicking this button will generate a temporary URL using a shared access signature and will trigger a browser download in a new tab.&#160; </p>  <p>Another new enhancement is the ability to edit blob metadata and properties within the portal using the <b>EDIT BLOB</b> command:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_366B5449.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_039B4DD5.png\" width=\"838\" height=\"610\" /></a> </p>  <p>From this dialog, you can see all of the relevant blob properties and user defined metadata.&#160; You can also edit some properties such as the <b>Content Type</b> as well as all of the metadata key value pairs.</p>  <h2><u>Media Services Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>This week’s release includes several update to Windows Azure Media Services. </p>  <p><u>Monitoring Metrics for on-demand streaming</u></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services enables you to easily stream video on-demand (and soon live) from Windows Azure – without having to setup your own streaming server.&#160; With this week’s update the dashboard view of your media service now displays monitoring metrics for on-demand streaming:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5A933F89.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0EC768D0.png\" width=\"859\" height=\"515\" /></a> </p>  <p><u>Improved Content and Samples</u></p>  <p>With this week’s release we have also updated the Media Services quick start page and added some helpful links as well as some sample code snippets that you can easily copy and paste into your code to start integrating Windows Azure Media Service tasks (typically encoding and streaming video) into your existing solutions:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_70E8E4CE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6C063112.png\" width=\"860\" height=\"596\" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>For example, the “Upload a video programmatically” code snippet will show you how to programmatically upload a video file into your Windows Azure Media Services account (it even includes your account name + key in the snippet so that you can literally copy/paste to try it out):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1510D00F.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6240C99A.png\" width=\"748\" height=\"435\" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h2><u>Cloud Service Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>In previous versions of the Windows Azure Management Portal, you could only upload a certificate PFX file. We listened to you feedback – with this week’s release, the portal now also supports upload of just the public key of the certificate 9e.g. a *.cer certificate file).</p>  <h2><u>Localization in 5 Additional Languages</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release, we have added additional localization support for <b>5 NEW LANGUAGES</b>: Russian, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional.&#160; You can select the language you want to use from the globe icon on the top of the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_44624599.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_587B6222.png\" width=\"828\" height=\"474\" /></a> </p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Store Support in 22 New Countries</u></h2>  <p>With this week’s release we have also expanded support for the Windows Azure Store to 33 countries (up from the previous 11 countries supported).&#160; The <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/01/23/windows-azure-store-new-add-ons-and-expanded-availability.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Store</a> is an awesome feature of Windows Azure and enables you to consume services from a variety of Microsoft and non-Microsoft services.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

Copy any JSON data into the clipboard, use a Paste Special command to paste it into a C# or VB.NET code file, and Visual Studio will automatically generate .NET classes inferred from the JSON. </p>  <p>Mobile Emulator support adds extensibility hooks so that third-party emulators can be installed as a VSIX. The installed emulators will show up in the F5 dropdown, so that developers can preview their websites on a variety of mobile devices. Read more about this feature in Scott Hanselman’s blog entry on <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CrossBrowserDebuggingIntegratedIntoVisualStudioWithBrowserStack.aspx\">the new BrowserStack integration with Visual Studio</a>.</p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET Web API Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, ASP.NET Web API now provides support for OData endpoints that support both ATOM and JSON-light formats. With OData you get support for rich query semantics, paging, $metadata, CRUD operations, and custom actions over any data source. Read more about ASP.NET Web API OData support at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api\">http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api</a>. </p>  <p>New built-in tracing functionality now lets you easily diagnose problems with Web API whether you’re running in Visual Studio or on Windows Azure. Tracing output from Web API is automatically written to the Visual Studio output window, IntelliTrace, and any other trace listener that you would like, including Windows Azure Diagnostics. The output shows the full Web API pipeline for all requests, including any exceptions or errors that occur, what controller and action were selected, model binding, the format that was negotiated, and the response. </p>  <p>Updated Web API projects now contain a link to an automatically generated help page that shows how to call your web API. The help page shows all of your API endpoints, the HTTP verbs they support, parameters, and sample request and response messages. You can customize the help page as you like, including adding <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yaohuang1/archive/2012/12/10/asp-net-web-api-help-page-part-3-advanced-help-page-customizations.aspx\">documentation</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yaohuang1/archive/2012/12/02/adding-a-simple-test-client-to-asp-net-web-api-help-page.aspx\">test client functionality</a>.&#160; This makes it really easy to create documentation pages for developers calling your services.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_01225169.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3C098432.png\" width=\"476\" height=\"338\" /></a></p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET SignalR</u></h2>  <p>ASP.NET SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to your applications. Real-time web functionality is the ability to have server-side code push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available.</p>  <p>You may have heard of the HTML5 WebSocket API that enables efficient bidirectional communication between the browser and server. SignalR uses Websockets when it is supported by the browser and the server, and gracefully falls back to other techniques and technologies when it is not (best of all your application code can stay the same regardless of which is being used).</p>  <p>SignalR provides a simple API for creating server-to-client remote procedure calls (RPC) that call JavaScript functions in client browsers from server-side .NET code. SignalR also includes API for connection management (for instance, connect and disconnect events), grouping connections, and authorization.</p>  <p>Included in today’s release is Visual Studio 2012 template support for creating SignalR projects as well as adding SignalR support to existing Web Forms and MVC applications:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_76F0B6FB.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6D978278.png\" width=\"628\" height=\"354\" /></a></p>  <p>Read more about SignalR at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/signalr\">http://www.asp.net/signalr</a>.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>ASP.NET Web Forms Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>ASP.NET Friendly URLs enable you to remove the .aspx extension from your Web Forms pages, making your sites’ URLs look cleaner. You can also pass parameters to pages as segments of the URL. For example, instead of ProductDetails.aspx?id=5 you can have ProductsDetails/5. With Friendly URLs you can also easily support mobile devices by creating mobile versions of pages:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>YourPage.aspx</strong> – This is the page that will be rendered by default on a browser.</li>    <li><strong>YourPage.Mobile.aspx</strong> – This is the version of the page that will be rendered by default on a mobile browser.</li>    <li><strong>YourPage.<i>Device</i>.aspx</strong> – You can write your own code to map a user-agent string to a specific device name. For example, you could have pages for Windows Phone, iPhone, and Android devices.</li> </ul>  <h2><u>ASP.NET MVC Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>A new Facebook Application template makes writing Facebook Canvas applications using ASP.NET MVC really easy. In a few simple steps, you can create a Facebook application that gets data from a logged in user and integrates with their friends. The template includes a new library to take care of all the plumbing involved in building a Facebook app, including authentication, permissions, accessing Facebook data and more. This lets you focus on building the business logic in your app. The Facebook apps you can build with this new template are hosted on the web and displayed inside the Facebook chrome via an iframe. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_721093F0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2162097B.png\" width=\"363\" height=\"485\" /></a></p>  <p><strong><u>Single Page Applications</u></strong></p>      <p>A new Single Page Application template for ASP.NET MVC is also now included and allows developers to build interactive client-side web apps using HTML 5, CSS 3, and the popular Knockout and jQuery JavaScript libraries – all on on top of ASP.NET Web API. </p>  <p>The default template creates a “todo” list application that demonstrates common practices for building a JavaScript HTML5 application that uses a RESTful server API. You can read more at <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/single-page-application\">http://www.asp.net/single-page-application</a>.</p>  <p>If you don’t want to use the new Knockout template there are 4 new community-created templates. These templates were built using the improved <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/fall-2012-update/custom-mvc-templates\">Custom MVC Template</a> support:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282649\" target=\"_blank\">BreezeJS</a> template that uses BreezeJS and Knockout for data binding and templating</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282647\" target=\"_blank\">Ember</a> template uses the latest version of Ember and Handlebars</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282648\" target=\"_blank\">DurandalJS</a> template is built using the new MVVM library DurandalJS as well as Knockout</li>    <li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282646\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Towel</a> uses BreezeJS, DurandalJS, Knockout, require.js and Bootstrap</li> </ul>  <p>You’ll see even more templates in the months ahead.</p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Authentication Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>A new pre-release of Windows Azure Authentication is also now available for MVC, Web Pages, and Web Forms. This feature enables your application to authenticate Office 365 users from your organization, corporate accounts synced from your on-premise Active Directory, or users created in your own custom Windows Azure Active Directory domain. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/fall-2012-update/windows-azure-authentication\">Windows Azure Authentication tutorial</a>.</p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>Today’s ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update has a lot of useful features for all developers using ASP.NET.&#160; Read the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=279941\" target=\"_blank\">release notes</a> to learn even more, and <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=282650\" target=\"_blank\">install it</a> today!</p>  <p><strong><font color=\"#ff0000\">Important Installation Note</font></strong>: If you have installed an earlier version of Mads Kristensen’s excellent (and free) <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6\" target=\"_blank\">Web Essentials 2012 extension</a>, you’ll want to update it to the latest version before installing today’s ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update.&#160; The latest version of the <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6\" target=\"_blank\">Web Essentials 2012 extension</a> works well with today’s release – if you have an older version you will get a runtime error when you launch Visual Studio.&#160; Updating to the latest version of the extension prior to installing the ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 update will fix this.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

[["author", "ScottGu"], ["content", "<p>During the BUILD 2012 conference we announced a new capability of Windows Azure: the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/overview/\">Windows Azure Store</a>. The Windows Azure Store makes it incredibly easy for you to discover, purchase, and provision premium add-on services, provided by our partners, for your cloud based applications. For example, you can use the Windows Azure Store to easily setup a MongoDB database in seconds, or quickly setup an analytics service like NewRelic that gives you deep insight into your application’s performance.</p>  <p>There is a growing list of app and data services now available through the Windows Azure Store, and the list is constantly expanding.&#160; Many services offered through the store include a free tier, which makes it incredibly easy for you to try them out with no obligation required.&#160; Services you decide to ultimately buy are automatically added to your standard Windows Azure bill – enabling you to add new capabilities to your applications without having to enter a credit card again nor setup a separate payment mechanism.&#160; </p>  <p>The Windows Azure Store is currently available to customers in 11 markets: US, UK, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Spain, and South Korea.&#160; Over the next few weeks we’ll be expanding the store to be available in even more countries and territories around the world.</p>  <h2><u>Signing up for an Add-On from the Windows Azure Store</u></h2>  <p>It is incredibly easy to start using a partner add-on from the Windows Azure store:</p>  <p>1) Sign-into the Windows Azure Management Portal</p>  <p>2) Click the New button (in the bottom-left corner) and then select the “Store” item within it:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_4EF1B32C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_42EFC2F8.png\" width=\"903\" height=\"470\" /></a></p>  <p>3) This will bring up UI that allows you to browse all of the partner add-ons available within the Store:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7DD6F5C1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_54CEE776.png\" width=\"828\" height=\"544\" /></a></p>  <p>You will see two categories of add-ons available: app services and data. Explore each to get an idea of the types of services available, and don’t forget to check back often, as the list is growing quickly!</p>  <p>4) Let’s try out a free app service from SendGrid, which lets you send e-mail from your application using a REST API or an SMTP server. Choose SendGrid from the list and click the next arrow.&#160; This will display more information about SendGrid, as well as a variety of plan options.&#160; Note that they offer a Free plan that allows you to send 6,000 emails/month, and then paid plans with more features and scale:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_68E803FF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2AEE7341.png\" width=\"812\" height=\"532\" /></a></p>  <p>5) Let’s select the free plan and click the next arrow.&#160; Doing so will display the final screen – which shows us how much this purchase will cost.&#160; In this case it will cost nothing.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1AE2353B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_15FF817F.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"537\" /></a></p>  <p>6) Click the “Purchase” button to complete the transaction (and if it was a non-free plan add it to your Windows Azure bill automatically).&#160; Once you click Purchase, SendGrid will provision an account for you and then you are ready to use it.&#160; No additional sign-up/billing steps required.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Using an Add-On from the Windows Azure Store</u></h2>  <p>The Windows Azure Management portal makes it really easy to track and manage the add-on services you sign-up for.&#160; Once the above steps are completed, the SendGrid service will show up in the list of “add ons” for your account.&#160; Click the “add-ons” tab within the portal to display and manage these:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_3F0A207B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_01108FBD.png\" width=\"875\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>  <p>Clicking on the SendGrid item will display information about the service – including details on how many emails I’ve used from my 200/day quota for the free tier:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5C12CF43.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_65026182.png\" width=\"876\" height=\"488\" /></a></p>  <p>A row of buttons at the bottom of the page lets you interact with the add-on:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>Manage</b> opens a new browser tab and signs you into the provider’s own admin portal without requiring you to enter a username or password (we automatically use single-sign-on with your azure account). For example, SendGrid’s admin portal lets you view statistics about email delivery and bounce rates. </li>    <li><b>Connection Info</b> provides you with the security credentials necessary to programmatically connect to the add-on’s service.

Notification Hubs provide a common API to send push notifications to multiple device platforms.&#160; Your app can send notifications in platform specific formats or in a platform-independent way.&#160; As of January 2013, Notification Hubs are able to push notifications to Windows 8 apps and iOS apps.&#160; Support for Android and Windows Phone will be added soon. </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li>     <p><strong>Efficient Pub/Sub Routing and Tag-based Multicast</strong>. Notification Hubs are optimized to enable push notification broadcast to thousands or millions of devices with low latency.&#160; Your server back-end can fire one message into a Notification Hub, and thousands/millions of push notifications can automatically be delivered to your users.&#160; Devices and apps can specify a number of <em>per-user</em> <em>tags</em> when registering with a Notification Hub. These tags do not need to be pre-provisioned or disposed, and provide a very easy way to send filtered notifications to an infinite number of users/devices with a single API call.&#160; Since tags can contain any app-specific string (e.g. user ids, favorite sports teams, stock symbols to track, location details, etc), their use effectively frees the app back-end from the burden of having to store and manage device handles or implement their own per-user notification routing information.&#160; </p>   </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li>     <p><b>Extreme Scale</b>. Notification Hubs enable you to reach millions of devices without you having to re-architect or shard your application.&#160; The pub/sub routing mechanism allows you to broadcast notifications in a super efficient way.&#160; This makes it incredibly easy to route and deliver notification messages to millions of users without having to build your own routing infrastructure.</p>   </li> </ul>  <ul>   <li><b>Usable from any Backend App</b>. Notification Hubs can be easily integrated into any back-end server app.&#160; It will work seamlessly with apps built with Windows Azure Mobile Services.&#160; It can also be used by server apps hosted within IaaS Virtual Machines (either Windows or Linux), Cloud Services or Web-Sites.&#160; This makes it easy for you to take advantage of it immediately without having to change the rest of your backend app architecture.</li> </ul>  <h2><u>Try Notification Hubs Today</u></h2>  <p> You can try the new Notification Hub support in Windows Azure by creating a new Notification Hub within the Windows Azure Management Portal – you can create one by selecting the <em>Service Bus Notification Hub</em> item under the “App Services” category in the <strong>New</strong> dialog:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1AB39405.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4352000C.png\" width=\"891\" height=\"644\" /></a></p>  <p>Creating a new Notification Hub takes less than a minute, and once created you can drill into it to see a dashboard view of activity with it.&#160; Among other things it allows you to see how many devices have been registered with it, how many messages have been pushed to it, how many messages have been successfully delivered via it, and how many have failed:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_39F8CB89.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2DF6DB55.png\" width=\"879\" height=\"575\" /></a></p>  <p>You can then click the “Configure” tab to register your Notification Hub with Microsoft’s Windows Notification System and Apple’s APNS service (we’ll add Android support in a future update):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_64D3C04C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_26DA2F8E.png\" width=\"879\" height=\"575\" /></a></p>  <p>Once this is setup, its simple to register any client app/device with a Notification Hub (optionally associating “tags” with them so that you can have the Notification Hub automatically filter for you who gets which messages).&#160; You can then broadcast messages to your users/mobile apps with only a few lines of code.</p>  <p>For example, below is some code that you could implement within your server back-end app to broadcast a message to all Windows 8 users registered with your Notification Hub:</p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 8pt 0.5in;

The Notification Hub will automatically handle the pub/sub scale-out infrastructure necessary to scale your message to any number of registered device listeners in a low-latency way without you having to worry about implementing any of that scale-out logic yourself (nor block on this happening within your own code).&#160;

This release is now live in production, supported by a <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">new media services dev center</a>, backed by an enterprise SLA, and is ready to be used for all media projects.</p>  <p>With today’s release, you now have everything you need to quickly build great, extremely scalable, end-to-end media solutions for streaming on-demand video to consumers on any device.&#160; For example, you can easily build a media service for delivering training videos to employees in your company, stream video content for your web-site, or build a premium video-on-demand service like Hulu or Netflix.&#160; Last year several broadcasters used Windows Azure Media Services to <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/08/21/windows-azure-media-services-and-the-london-2012-olympics.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">stream the London 2012 Olympics</a>.</p>  <h2><u>Media Platform as a Service </u></h2>  <p>With Windows Azure Media Services, you can stream video to HTML5, Flash, Silverlight, Windows 8, iPad, iPhone, Android, Xbox, Windows Phone and other clients using a wide variety of streaming formats:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_30781B63.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_2E3E2358.png\" width=\"845\" height=\"236\" /></a></p>  <p>Building a media solution that encodes and streams video to various devices and clients is a complex task.&#160; It requires hardware and software that has to be connected, configured, and maintained.&#160; Windows Azure Media Services makes this problem much easier by eliminating the need to provision and manage your own custom infrastructure.&#160; Windows Azure Media Services accomplishes this by providing you with a Media Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enables you to easily scale your business as it grows, and pay only for what you use. </p>  <p>As a developer, you can control Windows Azure Media Services by using <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">REST APIs or .NET and Java SDKs</a> to build a media workflow that can automatically upload, encode and deliver video.&#160; We’ve also developed a broad set of client SDKs and player frameworks which let you build completely custom video clients that integrate in your applications.&#160; This allows you to configure and control every aspect of the video playback experience, including inserting pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll, and overlay advertisement into your content.</p>  <h2><u>Upload, Encode, Deliver, Consume</u></h2>  <p>A typical video workflow involves uploading raw video to storage, encoding &amp; protecting the content, and then streaming that content to users who can consume it on any number of devices.&#160; For each of these major steps, we’ve built a number of features that you’ll find useful:</p>  <p><b><u>Upload</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services supports multiple different options to upload assets into Media Services:</p>  <ol>   <li>Using REST APIs, or .NET or Java SDKs you can upload files to the server over HTTP/S with AES 256 encryption.&#160; This works well for smaller sets of files and is for great uploading content on a day to day basis. </li>    <li><a href=\"http://blog-ndrouin.azurewebsites.net/?p=561\">Bulk upload</a> an entire media library with thousands of large files.&#160; Uploading large asset files can be a bottleneck for asset creation and by using a bulk ingesting approach, you can save a lot of time.&#160; For bulk upload, you can use the Bulk Ingest .NET Library or a partner upload solution such as <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/store/service/?name=aspera\" target=\"_blank\">Aspera</a> which uses UDP for transporting files at very rapid speeds.&#160; </li>    <li>If you already have content in Windows Azure blob storage, we also support blob to blob transfers and storage account to storage account transfers.&#160; </li>    <li>We also enable to you to upload content through the Windows Azure Portal – which is useful for small jobs or when first getting started.</li> </ol>  <p><b><u>Encode and then Deliver</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services provides built-in support for encoding media into a variety of different file-formats.&#160; With Windows Azure Media Services, you don’t need to buy or configure custom media encoding software or infrastructure – instead you can simply send REST calls (or use the .NET or Java SDK) to automate kicking off encoding jobs that Windows Azure Media Services will process and scale for you.</p>  <p>Last month, I <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/12/21/great-updates-to-windows-azure-mobile-services-web-sites-sql-data-sync-acs-media-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> we added <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/12/21/great-updates-to-windows-azure-mobile-services-web-sites-sql-data-sync-acs-media-more.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reserved capacity encoding support to Media Service</a> which gives you the ability to scale up the number of encoding tasks you can process in parallel. Using the SCALE page within the Windows Azure Portal, you can add reserved encoding units that let you encode multiple tasks concurrently (giving you faster encode jobs and predictable performance).&#160; </p>  <p>Today, we have also added new reserved capacity support for on-demand streaming (giving you more origin server capacity) - which can also now be provisioned on the same SCALE page in the management portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_502985DC.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3FB114E1.png\" width=\"755\" height=\"499\" /></a></p>  <p>In addition to giving your video service more origin streaming capacity to handle a greater number of concurrent users consuming different video content, our on-demand streaming support also now gives you a cool new feature we call <em>dynamic packaging</em>.</p>  <p>Traditionally, once content has been encoded, it needs to be packaged and stored for multiple targeted clients (iOS, XBox, PC, etc.).&#160; This traditional packaging process converts multi-bitrate MP4 files into multi-bitrate HLS file-sets or multi-bitrate Smooth Streaming files.&#160; This triples the storage requirements and adds significant processing cost and delay.</p>  <p>With dynamic packaging, we now allow users to store a single file format and stream to many adaptive protocol formats automatically.&#160; The packaging and conversion happens in real-time on the origin server which results in significant storage cost and time savings:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_1CEFDD24.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_3A64BEE1.png\" width=\"833\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>  <p>Today the source formats can be multi-bitrate MP4 or Smooth based, and these can be converted dynamically to either HLS or Smooth.&#160; The pluggable nature of this architecture will allow us, over the next few months, to also add DASH Live Profile streaming of fragmented MP-4 segments using time-based indexing as well.&#160; The support of HLS and the addition of DASH enables an ecosystem-friendly model based on common and standards-based streaming protocols, and ensures that you can target any type of device. </p>  <p><b><u>Consume</u></b></p>  <p>Windows Azure Media Services provides a large set of client player SDKs for all major devices and platforms, and they let you not only reach any device with a format that’s best suited for that device - but also build a custom player experience that uniquely integrates into your product or service.</p>  <p>Your users can consume media assets by building rich media applications rapidly on many platforms, such as Windows, iOS, XBox, etc.&#160; At this time, we ship <a href=\"http://mingfeiy.com/client-ecosystem-for-windows-azure-media-services/\">SDKs and player frameworks</a> for:</p>  <ul>   <li>Windows 8 </li>    <li>iOS </li>    <li>Xbox</li>    <li>Flash Player (built using Adobe OSMF) </li>    <li>Silverlight</li>    <li>Windows Phone</li>    <li>Android </li>    <li>Embedded devices (Connected TV, IPTV)</li> </ul>  <p>To get started with developing players, visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Developer tools for Windows Azure Media Services</a>. The SDKs and player frameworks contain player samples that you can use as-is or customize with very little effort. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_42E81E2B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_4931856A.png\" width=\"613\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>  <h2><b><u>Start Today</u></b></h2>  <p>I’m really excited about today’s the general availability (GA) release of Windows Azure Media Services.&#160; This release is now live in production, backed by an enterprise SLA, and is ready to be used for all projects.&#160; It makes building great media solutions really easy and very cost effective.</p>  <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/media/\">Windows Azure Media Services page</a> to learn more about the capabilities, and visit the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/media-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Media Service Dev Center</a> for tutorials, how-to articles, blogs, and more information and get started building applications with it today!</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.

[["author", "ScottGu"], ["content", "<p>This morning we released a number of enhancements to Windows Azure.&#160; These new capabilities include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Mobile Services (job scheduler support, Europe Region Support, Command Line Support) </li>    <li>Web Sites (scale improvements, integrated source control) </li>    <li>SQL Data Sync (support in the new HTML portal) </li>    <li>ACS Management (support in the new HTML portal) </li>    <li>Media Services (job and task management, blob storage support, reserved compute) </li>    <li>Virtual Network enhancements </li>    <li>Subscription Filtering Support </li>    <li>Windows Azure Store (now available in more countries) </li> </ul>  <p>All of these improvements are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; Below are more details on them:</p>  <h2><u>Mobile Services </u></h2>  <p>Windows Azure Mobile Services now supports the ability to easily schedule background jobs (aka CRON jobs) that execute on a pre-set timer interval, and which can run independently of a device accessing the service (ensuring that you don’t block or slow-down any requests from your users).&#160; This job scheduler functionality allows you to perform a variety of useful scenarios without having to create or manage a separate VM.&#160; Some of the scenarios you can enable with it include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Periodically purging old/duplicate data from your tables. </li>    <li>Periodically querying and aggregating data from external web service (tweets, RSS entries, location information) and cache it in your tables for subsequent use. </li>    <li>Periodically processing/resizing images submitted by users of your service. </li>    <li>Scheduling the sending of push notifications or SMS messages to your customers to ensure they arrive at the right time of the day. </li> </ul>  <p>Using today’s release you can now easily register background tasks by navigating to the new <b>Scheduler</b> tab of your mobile service in the Windows Azure portal, and then by clicking the <strong>Create</strong> button:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_0AFBFE83.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5EDF0191.png\" width=\"836\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>  <p>Doing this enables you to name a new job, and select how often you want to run it (note: you can also change the schedule later on):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2EB7B6CE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_09B9F655.png\" width=\"836\" height=\"478\" /></a></p>  <p>Once a job is created, you can drill into it and select the <b>Script </b>tab to author the server script you want to be executed on a recurring interval.&#160; As an example, the below script fetches Twitter updates about “red polos” and sends out a push notification from the mobile service: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5992AB91.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_64BEC68C.png\" width=\"865\" height=\"560\" /></a></p>  <p>Once you’ve entered the script, you can save and then click the <b>Run Once</b> button to execute a trial run. The <b>Run Once</b> functionality lets you easily test your job script before you enable the job for recurring execution.&#160; To enable recurring execution of the job, click either the <strong>Enable </strong>button within the script-view or go back to the <b>Scheduler</b> tab, select the job, and click the <strong>Enable </strong>button to activate it.</p>  <p>This new job scheduler capability makes it incredibly easy to integrate background work within your Mobile Service (without having to create or manage a separate VM to run it in).&#160; It can be used by all Mobile Service (even the free-tier level).&#160; The free-tier of Mobile Services includes support that allows you to run one background job every hour.&#160; If you upgrade your mobile service to have a reserved instance you can run up to 10 jobs every 15 minutes.</p>  <p>Check-out the Windows Azure Mobile Services documentation for an even more in-depth <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/schedule-backend-tasks/\">job scheduler tutorial</a>.</p>  <p><u>Mobile Service Region Support in Europe</u></p>  <p>Before today, our preview of Windows Azure Mobile Services was only supported in the US East and US West regions of Windows Azure.&#160; With this week’s update you can now also create Mobile Services in the North Europe region as well. As with every Windows Azure service, over time we will extend Mobile Services to all Windows Azure regions world-wide:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_53DA229C.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_0F2D885B.png\" width=\"559\" height=\"371\" /></a></p>  <p><u>Mobile Service Command Line Support</u></p>  <p>Earlier this year we released a cross-platform Windows Azure Command Line Tool (a.k.a ‘azure’) that allows you to manage Windows Azure Web Sites, VMs and other services from the command line on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can learn more about it <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/command-line-tools/\">here</a>.&#160; Today we have released an update for this tool that adds support for Windows Azure Mobile Services as well.&#160; To get started, install the ‘azure’ tool for <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=275464&amp;clcid=0x409\">Windows</a> or <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=253471&amp;clcid=0x409\">Mac</a>. </p>  <p>If you haven’t used the tool before, you need to perform a one-time step and download/import the Windows Azure management credentials for your account. In a command prompt run the following command to download Windows Azure publish settings:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure account download</font></p>  <p>then import the .publishsettings file you just downloaded:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure account import &quot;C:\\temp\\my-credentials.publishsettings&quot;</font></p>  <p>Once you do this you’ll be able to access your Windows Azure subscription and perform operations against it entirely from the command-line.&#160; For example, using today’s update we can now create a new Window Azure Mobile Service entirely from the command-line (no portal interaction required at all):</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile create scottgucli</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_786E40D1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_05D453D8.png\" width=\"681\" height=\"263\" /></a></p>  <p>And with that simple command we now have a newly created Windows Azure Mobile Service!</p>  <p>Creating new tables with the mobile service can likewise now be done entirely from the command-line:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile table create scottgucli products</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_6C6C509D.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_19ED7061.png\" width=\"681\" height=\"167\" /></a></p>  <p>Many users have asked for the ability to directly upload scripts from their file system (without having to go through the portal) and the new CLI support makes this really easy. For example, to upload an “insert” script for the products table we just created above you can use the following command:</p>  <p><font face=\"Courier New\">&gt; azure mobile script upload scottgucli table/products.insert -f c:\\code\\products.js</font></p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_20A079E4.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_27538367.png\" width=\"841\" height=\"191\" /></a></p>  <p>Now this script will run every time a record is inserted into the products table.</p>  <h2><u>Web Sites</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release we have increased the scaling capabilities of our Windows Azure Web Sites service.&#160; </p>  <p>Previously a web-site could only be scaled up to run across 3 shared instances or 3 reserved VMs.&#160; With today’s release we now support the ability for you to scale up a web-site to run across 6 shared instances (beyond which it is cheaper to switch to a reserved instance):</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_5BF3DFA2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_6B967B64.png\" width=\"826\" height=\"493\" /></a></p>  <p>With today’s release we also now support the ability for you to scale up a web-site to run across 10 reserved VM instances (where you are guaranteed to be the only customer using those VMs).&#160; You can use either Small, Medium, or Large sized VMs when doing this:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_090B5D22.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;

Choose the <strong>NEW-&gt;Website-&gt;Custom Create</strong> command to try this out:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2F039E29.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;

SQL Data Sync lets you synchronize data between multiple SQL databases.&#160; These SQL databases can span across your on-premises environment and the cloud, or across multiple cloud hosted databases (for example: within multiple Windows Azure regions around the world).&#160; It is a very powerful capability that can enable a variety of interesting scenarios.</p>  <p>To use SQL Data Sync, go to the SQL Databases section of the new Windows Azure Management Portal and click on the new <strong>ADD SYNC </strong>command in the bottom tray of it:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40768FB2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;

Give it a name.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_693C37BF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_7DC1873D.png\" width=\"610\" height=\"418\" /></a></p>  <p>2. Choose the hub database, and provide connection credentials.&#160; The hub database is the central database within the group and must be a SQL Database in Windows Azure: </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40342974.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_349E6C35.png\" width=\"607\" height=\"415\" /></a></p>  <p>3. Then add a reference database, and provide connection credentials.&#160; Think of reference databases as “spoke” or “member” databases that connect with the hub database.&#160; They can be any combination of on-premise SQL Servers or other Windows Azure SQL Databases.&#160; They can sync bi-directionally with the hub, to the hub, or from the hub:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_14172C83.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_561D9BC4.png\" width=\"692\" height=\"481\" /></a></p>  <p>Once you’ve completed the above steps, your sync group is setup. </p>  <p><b><u>DEFINING SYNC RULES</u></b></p>  <p>You can now drill into the sync group to define your sync rules, manage the reference databases, add new reference databases, configure sync settings, and view historical sync logs.&#160; Note that you must define your sync rules via the <b>SYNC RULES </b>tab before syncing will begin.&#160; These rules determine the tables, columns, and even the rows that will be involved in the sync. You will want to choose the rules based on the needs of the application. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_7F283AC0.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1A6093C2.png\" width=\"654\" height=\"356\" /></a></p>  <p><b><u>CONFIGURING SYNC</u></b></p>  <p>Once the sync rules have been defined, the sync group can be synchronized, either on demand using the <b>SYNC</b> button or on regular scheduled interval.&#160; Use the <b>CONFIGURE</b> tab to setup a sync schedule to have the synchronization happen automatically.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_07AB9A0B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_22E3F30C.png\" width=\"654\" height=\"506\" /></a></p>  <p>Once setup, your databases will automatically synchronize.&#160; This can work either between your on-premises environment and the cloud, or between multiple cloud databases (for example: within multiple Windows Azure regions around the world).&#160; It is a very powerful capability that can enable a variety of compelling scenarios.</p>  <h2><u>Active Directory Access Control Management (ACS) Support</u></h2>  <p>With today’s release, you can also now create and manage Windows Azure Active Directory Access Control namespaces from the new Windows Azure Management Portal. </p>  <p>Windows Azure AD Access Control is a service that lets you authenticate and authorize users for your web applications and services, while allowing authentication and authorization features to be factored out of your code. ACS works with standards-based identity providers, including enterprise directories such as Active Directory, and web identities such as Windows Live ID, Google, Yahoo!, and Facebook. For more information, see Windows Azure AD <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=272724\">Access Control</a>.</p>  <p><u>Creating an ACS Namespace</u></p>  <p>To create an Access Control namespace, click <b>NEW </b>in the Windows Azure Management Portal, and select <b>APP SERVICES</b> <b>-&gt; ACCESS CONTROL -&gt;QUICK CREATE</b>.&#160; In the namespace field, type the name of the Access Control namespace that you want to create:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_40C507BE.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_5BFD60BF.png\" width=\"873\" height=\"289\" /></a></p>  <p><u>Managing a Namespace</u></p>  <p>To manage an Access Control namespace, click on the new <strong>Active Directory </strong>node in the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_49486708.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1201DFCD.png\" width=\"845\" height=\"470\" /></a></p>  <p>Then, select the namespace you want to manage, and click the <b>MANAGE</b> button in the command bar at the bottom of the screen.&#160; This will open the ACS Management Portal.&#160; You can additionally move your ACS namespaces from one subscription to another via the <b>CHANGE SUBSCRIPTION</b> command in the bottom of the page. </p>  <p>For more information about other recent enhancements that make Windows Azure AD more useful for developers, read Alex Simons’ blog post <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/07/enhancements-to-windows-azure-active-directory-preview.aspx\">here</a>, and Bill Hilf’s post <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/11/27/windows-azure-active-directory-processes-200-billion-authentications-connecting-people-data-and-devices-around-the-globe.aspx\">here</a>.&#160; Even more Active Directory functionality will be integrated within the Windows Azure Portal next year.</p>  <h2><u>Media Service Enhancements</u></h2>  <p>Today’s release contains a number of great enhancements to Windows Azure Media Services.&#160; This release includes investments to:</p>  <ul>   <li>Job and Task management </li>    <li>Adding content from a Windows Azure storage account </li>    <li>Scaling your media services account to increase encoding concurrency </li> </ul>  <p><u>Job and Task Management</u></p>  <p>You can now track the progress and history of your media encoding jobs from within the Windows Azure Portal.&#160; The new <b>JOBS</b> tab within the Media Services extension lets you define custom queries for jobs by status, timeframe, or Job Id:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_21A47B8F.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_25B15A12.png\" width=\"838\" height=\"658\" /></a></p>  <p>The results of your queries will appear below the query editor.&#160; You can expand jobs to see information about the tasks that make up the job giving you deeper insight into each individual job and determine where things are progressing as planned or might require attention. You can also select a job within the list to either cancel the job or view details including errors related to the tasks.</p>  <p><b><u>Adding Content from Windows Azure Storage</u></b></p>  <p>Prior to this release, the only way to get content into your media services account was to write code using the Azure Media SDK, or upload a file within the portal from your local computer.&#160; Today we are introducing a new feature within the Windows Azure Portal that lets you choose existing media files from Windows Azure Blob Storage, thereby reducing your upload latency.&#160; From the <b>CONTENT </b>tab within the Media Services extension, you can select the <b>UPLOAD </b>command.&#160; </p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_70A75B92.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_792ABADC.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>  <p>Notice the file browser now offers a <b>FROM STORAGE </b>option in addition to the previous “FROM LOCAL” support we already shipped.&#160; Note that the 200 MB limit mentioned in the header only applies to the <b>FROM LOCAL</b> option.&#160; Files sizes in the tens of gigabytes are supported via the <b>FROM STORAGE </b>option:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_2F9B6CDF.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_643BC91A.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"448\" /></a></p>  <p>The <b>FROM STORAGE</b> option will open the storage browser; you will be able to select a media file from blob storage from here.&#160; </p>  <p><b><u>Reserved Capacity for Media Service Jobs</u></b></p>  <p>With today’s release we have also added a new capability that allows you to scale up the number of encoding tasks you are processing.&#160; By default, we only support having one active encoding task at a time.&#160; Using the new <b>SCALE</b> page, you can reserve encoding units that let you encode multiple tasks concurrently and have even more processing power reserved for your media workflows:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_31D7F59B.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_73DE64DC.png\" width=\"803\" height=\"369\" /></a></p>  <h2><u>Virtual Networking Simplifications</u></h2>  <p>Based on customer feedback, we have significantly simplified the virtual network creation workflow within the Windows Azure Portal.&#160; In an earlier release, we had introduced a “Quick Create” workflow that simplified the most common virtual networking scenarios. In this release, we have further simplified the “Custom Create” experience to make creating more advanced scenarios easier as well.

Some users have one subscription for each department in their company; others have one for each environment (development, testing, and production).&#160; Some users even have one for each external customer that they work with.&#160; Regardless of which category you fall into, you might find that managing all of the resources across all subscriptions can be challenging, difficult to navigate, and can result in a sluggish experience.</p>  <p>Starting today a new <strong>subscription</strong> filter UI now appears next to your user name in the top right-hand side of the Windows Azure portal to help filter your views by one or more subscriptions.&#160; Selecting it will display a drop-down list that enables you to quickly filter which subscriptions you want to see in the portal:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_0A5B4628.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/scottgu/image_thumb_1C3A6AA6.png\" width=\"812\" height=\"514\" /></a></p>  <p>By default, all of your subscriptions are selected and loaded into the portal.&#160; Using the dropdown, you can now pick and choose exactly which subscriptions you want to manage.&#160; This will provide a few noticeable benefits: </p>  <ul>   <li>Resources associated with hidden subscriptions are <b>filtered out</b> of all the experiences across the portal. </li>    <li>Your filter selection <b>roams with you across sessions and devices</b>.&#160; If you set a filter on your laptop it will take affect when you return to your desktop or mobile device. </li>    <li>Users with many subscriptions will notice a <b>significant performance improvement</b> when loading only a small subset of their subscriptions since data for subscriptions that are filtered out is never loaded. </li> </ul>  <p>Note: If you only have one subscription, this change doesn’t affect you one bit.&#160; Your experience remains unchanged.&#160; In fact, you’ll only see the subscription filter UI show-up if you have more than subscription.</p>  <h2><u>Windows Azure Store Now Available in More Countries</u></h2>  <p>This week we have also expanded the number of countries that the Windows Azure Store is available within (previously it was only available in the United States).&#160; The Windows Azure Store enables you to easily subscribe to services provided by 3rd party partners of ours – and have them automatically added to your Windows Azure bill.&#160; It is an incredibly cool capability – and one I’ll be blogging a lot more about shortly.</p>  <p>In the mean-time, try it out by selecting the <strong>New-&gt;Store</strong> command within the portal and sign-up for one of the services in it today.&#160; </p>  <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>  <p>The above features are now available to start using immediately (note: some of the services are still in preview).&#160; Below are more details on them:If you don’t already have a Windows Azure account, you can sign-up for a <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">free trial</a> and start using them today.&#160; Visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Developer Center</a> to learn more about how to build apps with it.</p>  <p>Hope this helps,</p>  <p>Scott</p>  <p><em>P.S.
